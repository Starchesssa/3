About this item
Smart home meets smart lawn - manage your lawn with the touch of a button and maintain a yard your neighbor's will envy; the Connect@Home app allows you to set and adjust your Automower's cutting schedule with ease (Bluetooth connectivity works up to 100 ft)
Guided by hidden boundary wires, Automower knows how to smartly maneuver around your yard and when to return to the charging station for a battery recharge
Quiet enough to run at night, you'll never have to worry about disturbing your neighbors again with noise or fumes
Rain or shine, Automower can continuously mow, allowing the very fine grass clippings to act as natural fertilizer for your grass - no more bagging or raking required
