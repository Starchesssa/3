Title: Power Pet Automatic Dog Door Product Review

Description:
A review of the power pet dog door collar sensors.  These items rapidly corrode and rust after even a little moisture or humidity which prevents the video sensor in the door from working.  As you can see from the video, the board and transitors are poorly attached and inserting the battery is challenging particularly if you don't make proper contact with the braided connector.  The customer support for this product is very poor, its difficult to reach the manufacturer and they provide no returns
