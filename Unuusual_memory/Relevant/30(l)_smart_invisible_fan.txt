Title: Introducing VENTZ - The original rider cooling system

Description:
Ventz is a clever product that attaches easily to your jacket and helps to cool you down. When riding in warm weather an invisible layer of hot air, trapped in your jacket, raises your core body temperature to uncomfortable levels, which can cause a dangerous loss of concentration. Ventz creates a flow of soothing air that removes the trapped heat, making your journey cooler and more comfortable.Safe and comfortable to wear, Ventz is effective for both the rider and pillion passenger.
