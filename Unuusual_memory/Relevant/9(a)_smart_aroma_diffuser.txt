Title: Smart Wifi Wireless Essential Oil Aromatherapy Diffuser

Description:
INTELLIGENT AROMATHERAPY – A great addition to your smart home that is powered intelligently and wifi compatible. Use it like a normal diffuser or download the companion app to control features like LED color, mist intensity, timer settings, scheduling, and more directly from your phone. Our smart diffuser is also Alexa and Google Home compatible and can be used with echo/tap/dot to control simply by using your voice. A large 400ml water tank allows for up to 12 hours of continuous mist.
ULTRASONIC VAPORIZER – Our smart diffuser works by creating 360° ultrasonic frequencies that instantly vaporize water and oil molecules into the air. The result is a much healthier alternative than older style heat diffusers that can damage essential oils during the diffusion process.
CREATE SCHEDULES – Scheduling is here! Our smart diffuser allows you to create regular schedules in the app so you can get your diffuser to work at your scheduled times each day or on certain days that you choose.
ALEXA & GOOGLE HOME – Use our included quickstart guides to connect to the app and then either to your existing Alexa or Google Home accounts. You can then use your voice to conveniently control your smart diffuser including colors, mist settings, and other functions.
