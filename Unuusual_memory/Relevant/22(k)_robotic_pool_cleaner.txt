With its cordless design, say goodbye to tangled wires and power short-outs. Just press the ON button, drop it into the pool, and let it clean—no hassle, no worries.

Equipped with dual-drive motors delivering 40 watts of suction power, this vacuum moves at 36 feet per minute, easily picking up everything from sand and small stones to leaves across your pool floor.

It runs on a 5200mAh rechargeable battery, giving you efficient, deep cleaning every time. And the best part? It only operates underwater, so it’s both safe and reliable.

Whether you have an above-ground or in-ground pool, the INSE Y10 has you covered with a large 2-liter filter and the ability to clean up to 1,100 square feet on a single charge.

When the battery runs low, it automatically parks itself near the pool wall for easy retrieval—thanks to its smart self-parking technology and handy floating rope.

And once it’s done? Just rinse it off and store it.
