Title: First Look at the Vertical Horizons 1.5m Hydroponics Growing Tower

Description:
http://www.vhhydro.com
The hydroponics towers from Vertical Horizons are now available in 3 sizes - 1m (for 18 plants), 1.5m (for 30 plants) and 2m (for 45 plants) and the cost is excellent considering the care and detail involved in the manufacturing. They come with everything needed to create a productive vertical garden and everything is food safe, recycled or recyclable.
Hydroponic systems take very little maintenance and produce great yields on a tiny footprint.
In my opinion the incredibly low running costs, high yields and low maintenance make hydroponic systems the method of choice for my leafy veg growing although I have grown micro bush tomatoes and various herbs in them no problem.
As the nutrient requirements can be very different for leafy and fruiting plants I prefer to have separate systems for each type of plants so I can get the nutrients in solution right for the plant - that way they grow faster, mature quickly and yields are always great.

To be honest I've not much idea of what Rumble is or does but it seems quite popular among people more tech-savvy than me....and somehow plenty of people have already found the videos judging by the views (and 'Rumbles'?).
Both Odysee and Rumble have new videos uploaded to them as soon as they upload on YouTube.
