Title: CES 2025: Plantaform Smart Indoor Gardens

Description:
Allison Sheridan interviews Renata Scorsone from Plantaform about their innovative smart home garden that uses fog to grow plants. 

Plantaform has a minimalist modern design that fits into your home decor. It comes in black or white and is shaped like an egg about 30" tall with windows on the sides for viewing the progress of your plant growth.

Plantaform uses fogponics to grow plants, an advanced form of aeroponics that uses an ultra-fine mist to deliver water and nutrients to plant roots. This highly efficient method allows for better oxygenation and nutrient absorption compared to traditional soil-based and other hydroponic techniques. 

Pantaform's intuitive app makes gardening accessible to everyone. It guides the user through each step of the growing process from seeding to harvest. 

Plantaform provides Plant Pod Packs which are pre-seeded cartridges specially designed for the Plantaform garden. Users can select from leafy greens, to herbs, to tomatoes to customize their gardens based on their culinary preferences and nutritional needs. 

The interview setting is the Pepcom show floor at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
