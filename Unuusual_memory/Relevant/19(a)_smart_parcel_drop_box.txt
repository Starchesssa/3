Title: CES 2019: Danby Parcel Guard Smart Mailbox

Description:
Allison Sheridan interviews Cory Weirmier from Danby about Parcel Guard, the first smart mailbox that will be certified by the USPS. Parcel Guard's anti-theft drop slot will fit 95% of all standard delivery box sizes with the option of unlocking the bottom door for larger parcels. Equipped with an IP camera, Parcel Guard is made of structural web plastic (strong as steel), can be secured to the ground, and has a tamper alarm that can be turned on or off. Using the associated app, you can lock and unlock Parcel Guard from anywhere, see whoâ€™s at your front door, track your parcel deliveries and get notified when parcels arrive. The setting is the CES Unveiled at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.
