Title: LeafGuard: Save Your Plants with This DIY Smart Watering System!

Description:
Smart Irrigation Monitoring System

In this video, Iâ€™m sharing my passion project, LeafGuard, a DIY smart irrigation system to keep my Money Plant thriving while Iâ€™m away on a two-week trip. After a heartbreaking plant loss in 2020, I wasnâ€™t taking any chances with my new pet plant! Watch how I scaled down a college irrigation project using a NodeMCU ESP8266, soil moisture sensor, and a 5L water container to create a compact, reliable system with battery backup and Wi-Fi monitoring.
