Title: CES 2016: Hydrao Smart Shower Head

Description:
Allison interviews Gabriel Della-Monica from Smart and Blue about their new Hydrao smart shower head. The Hydrao indicates when you've exceeded the amount of water you've set by blinking colored lights on the shower head.  The accompanying Hydrao mobile app allows you to set your desired water usage for each shower and to see water your usage levels per day, month, or year. Hydro is available now in France and will be available in the U.S. in September 2016.  The setting is the CES Unveiled show floor in the Mandalay Bay Hotel.
