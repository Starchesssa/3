Title: Haier Asu smartwatch with in-built Projector

Description:
The Asu smartwatch from Haier is a bulky smartwatch but as you know you got to lose a thing to get another. The Asu smartwatch is not very stylish wearable but it is one of the most futuristic wearables. The projector part is located at the right side of the smartwatch which is a perfect place to put it so it can project the information directly to your hand. The projection on the hand is very clear because the skin is just a few centimeters away from the projector.
The Asu smartwatch comes with 1.5 inch touchscreen with 240 x 240 resolution. It is powered by a 1.2 GHz processor and comes with 1GB internal storage. Other than these, it comes with heart rate monitor, GPS, 4G LTE and a gyroscope sensor. The Asu smartwatch features an IP65 rating which makes it resistant to dust and water.
