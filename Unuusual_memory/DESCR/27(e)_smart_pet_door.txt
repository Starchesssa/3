The Security Boss Kennel Clad Guillotine door is the work horse model of the Kennel Clad Doors. The Standard Guillotine door is constructed of 1/16' thick aluminum plate, reinforced on all 4-sides with our customized aluminum channel. This simple, yet rugged design is a great alternative for those customers who are frustrated with the old white plastic guillotine doors that always appear dirty, and seem to have the look of a 20 year old door after a few short weeks of use. The Standard will out perform any plastic door while providing you with a smart looking door that will retain it's appearance for many many years. All components are naturally rust resistant and can easily withstand frequent chemical exposure from repeated kennel washings.
The rails used for the Kennel Clad Standard are the same as used in the premiere Kennel Clad Insulated Guillotine door. This allows you the choice to later upgrade the panel door itself with the insulated version, without having to replace your rails. Because these doors are reinforced around the perimeter of the panel doors, the inherent strength will easily contain even the most aggressive occupants. The hardware and assembly kit is included for complete installation.
