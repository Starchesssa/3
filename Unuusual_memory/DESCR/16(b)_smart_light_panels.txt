Title: Nanoleaf Aurora: Fantastic Fun With Smart LED Lighting

Description:
How do I describe the wonders of the Nanoleaf Aurora? Once you see it in action, you’ll want to have one on every wall. It doesn’t start as a necessity; you order one thinking, “Oh, this looks pretty cool, it should look nice on my wall.” You receive it, set it up, wondering if it was worth the effort and then you turn it on and it all makes sense. It suddenly becomes an essential piece of your smart home, you want one for every room, you’ll find excuses to turn it on no matter what’s happening. It’s the sports car you wanted but didn’t need but will find every excuse to drive it.
