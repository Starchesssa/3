Autonomous Security Robots (ASRs)

We are Autonomous Security Robots (ASRs).  We use a unique combination of self-driving technology, robotics, artificial intelligence (A.I.) and electric "vehicles" to provide humans with extra eyes, ears and a voice on the ground. We can be in multiple locations at the same time, helping you protect the places people live, work, study and visit.
‍
We are self-driving (autonomous) security robots.  We drive around your campus without any human intervention contributing to your overall security mission.  We gather and deliver unprecedented levels of data and actionable intelligence to your security team to assist in making smarter, safer and faster decisions.  You will not be responsible for servicing or maintaining our daily operating capabilities because that is included as part of the Knightscope experience.  You will be able to access information and analytics from anywhere in the world where you have access to the Internet, a Chrome browser and your user credentials.  And you will have the 24/7/365 support of a live human being if ever there is a need for assistance.

Similar to the original purpose of a security guard, we deter, detect, observe and report.  However, we have game changing benefits that evolution has not yet gifted to our humans.  We can see a full 360-degrees (even in the dark), stream that video directly to you, and keep a high-definition record of it for up to 30 days.  Our powerful analytics allow us to detect a human being that the human eye may not even be able to see under certain conditions.  We don’t rely on human memory or note taking.  We don’t just have ears, but a sensitive 16-microphone array with two-way audio functionality allowing humans to have a live conversation with another human using us as the communication medium.

When we see something, we say something by reporting the incident or “Alert” in real time via email, text, or the included cloud-based software.  We don’t rely on having to complete various in-person or online training courses, but rather on machine learning, deep learning and refining our detection capabilities so that we may reduce or even eliminate our margin of error, which makes these alerts better over time.

Our humans love to brag about us and share the full depth of our capabilities, so please feel free to book a demo today to learn how we have helped so many others just like you
