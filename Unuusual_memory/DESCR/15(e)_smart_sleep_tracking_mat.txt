Title: Unboxing my sleep, the Nokia Sleep Pad for ultimate sleep quality awareness and management

Description:
I have had the opportunity to test this product and as it is quite new I wanted to share the unboxing with you all, I guess many are wondering what is inside it as it is a pneumatic sensor, very different from what you might expect!
