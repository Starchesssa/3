Title: Turning Food Scraps into Compost

Description:
Ever wonder what happens to the food scraps you drop off weekly at Ramsey County collection sites? The material is sent to a compost facility in Rosemount, Minnesota where it is processed into finished compost to be used in gardens, landscaping and construction projects. Ramsey County created this new video to show you how the composting process works. Subtitled videos available in English, Spanish and Somali.
