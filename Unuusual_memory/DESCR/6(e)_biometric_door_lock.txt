Best Smartlock Doorknob for Airbnb Hosts - Passcode, Keyless Entry Door Handle and Fingerprint

This is a demonstration video on how to open the door handle. Closing the door automatically locks the doorknob. I have been using this lock for the last year in my vacation rental and it's held up! Love the quality feel of the knob and like that it also comes with a key. I only use the keypad feature for my cleaners and guests.
