Title: CES 2025: WYBOT Solar Powered Robotic Pool Cleaner

Description:
Allison Sheridan interviews Josè Vailès about their solar-powered robotic pool cleaner called WYBOT. 

The WYBOT pool cleaner has no cables or hoses attached. It cleans the pool autonomously using battery power, and when it needs more power, it automatically goes to a docking station at the side of the pool. 

The docking station has a small solar panel on the pool deck that recharges the WYBOT’s battery. After receiving a full recharge, WYBOT automatically detaches from the docking station and continues on with its pool cleaning function. This is similar to how a Roomba vacuum works in the home. 

The currently available WYBOT S2 requires the user to clean debris from the unit occasionally, while the soon-to-be-released S3 cleans debris automatically when the unit attaches to the docking station. 

The interview setting is the Showstoppers show floor at the Bellagio Hotel.
