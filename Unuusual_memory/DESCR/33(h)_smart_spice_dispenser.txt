Dear New Subscriber,
Thank you for stopping by my channel. Here you will find lifestyle, beauty and mommy videos. I have four kids so needless to say I have picked up a few tips and tricks on how to run my household as efficient as possible. I still like to look polished and that can be a challenge while caring for little ones. So I have developed some systems and routines to make sure I get "me" time. I homeschool and have been doing so for the last five years so you will also see the occasional homeschool video. I hope to help other mommies out there cut the researching time down and make more time doing what ever you enjoy. You deserve it! I cant wail to get to know each and every one of you. Talk to you soon friend!                                                                                                  
*C H A N N E L  P O L I C Y !!!*
Welcome to my house. This is my channel and Im literally welcoming you into my home. My time is valuable as I know your is so please don’t waste anyone else's time by adding negativity to our day. My house is a safe space where friends can speak freely. I want to be friends and unfortunately I cant welcome you into my home or be friends with you if your going to be negative. So please address me directly and not as if I were in the room and you were talking to someone else right in front of me. That would be rude right? Please respect yourself by speaking with dignity and resect others by speaking your truth in a positive way. I am so excited to get to know you so don’t come to my house without saying hello. Lets get to know each other! I want to meet other mom’s or people that I can relate to, feed off each others positive energies, share experiences and build a relationship with. Thank you for watching my video and stoping by to visit. Hope to see you soon!
