Title: Betta SE Automatic Solar Powered Pool Skimmer Review

Description:
This channel is dedicated to self-improvement and relationships.  If I run across an amazing product many people could benefit from, I will do a review of it.  This product is a game changer if you own a pool!

This product changed my life and helped me regain some of my precious time.  If you own a pool, this is a must have.  We live in a wooded area where leaves, bugs, and pollen collect on the surface A LOT.  This machine is trouble free, solar powered, and our pool has never been cleaner.  Betta travels around our pool without issues 24/7.  The only thing I have to do is clean it about every five days.

I ran into two different issues: the battery would die if we have about four thick overcast days in a row, and it would get stuck on our stairs.  A few tweaks to the pool and this thing is solid!
