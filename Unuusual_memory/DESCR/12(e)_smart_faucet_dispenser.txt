Touch it on. Touch it off. Whether you have two full hands or 10 messy fingers, Delta Touch2O Technology helps keep your kitchen faucet clean, even when your hands aren’t. A simple touch anywhere on the spout or handle with your wrist or forearm activates the flow of water at the temperature where your handle is set. The Delta TempSense LED light changes color to alert you to the water’s temperature and eliminates any possible surprises or discomfort. Delta MagnaTite Docking uses a powerful integrated magnet to set your pull down sprayer precisely into place and hold it there so it stays docked when not in use. Delta kitchen faucets with diamond seal technology perform like new for life with a patented design which reduces leak points, is less hassle to install and lasts twice as long as the industry standard. Kitchen sink faucets with touch-clean spray holes allow you to easily wipe away calcium and lime build-up with the touch of a finger. You can install with confidence. Industry standard is based on ASME A112.18.1 of 500,000 cycles.
