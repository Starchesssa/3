Title: Indoor Herb Garden Setup in the Idoo Hydroponic System.

Description:
In this video I will be sharing my Indoor Herb Garden Setup using the Idoo Hydroponic System.   Growing herbs indoors can be very easy whether you grow in soil or use a DWC system such as the Idoo or Aerogarden.   I will show you how I plan to harvest and dry my herbs using no power.
