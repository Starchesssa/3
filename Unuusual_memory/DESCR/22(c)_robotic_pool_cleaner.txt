The Dolphin Nautilus CC pool vacuum robot is an advanced cleaning tool designed specifically for above-ground pools up to 10 meters in length. This model offers exceptional performance thanks to a combination of innovative technologies and practical features, ensuring a clean pool with minimal effort. The Dolphin Nautilus CC stands out for its ability to climb the walls of the pool, reaching every corner for a complete cleaning. Its active scrubbing brush is particularly effective in removing impurities embedded on the walls and floor of the pool, transforming each pass into a deep clean. In addition, its easily accessible filter basket at the top allows for simple and hassle-free maintenance, ensuring crystal clear water every time you use it.

The "Plug and Play" system makes using the Dolphin Nautilus CC extremely simple: simply plug it in, place it in the pool, turn on the power, and in just two hours, your pool is spotless. This model also features "CleverClean" technology, which systematically scans the pool to ensure effective cleaning, regardless of the shape of the surface. The weekly programming function allows you to set regular cleaning cycles, ensuring a clean pool at all times. The active brushes, which rotate twice as fast as traditional brushes, remove even the most stubborn contaminants.

Some of the advantages of the Dolphin Nautilus CC include its cleaning efficiency for pools up to 10 meters long, its ability to climb walls for a complete clean, the easy access to its filter basket, as well as its "Plug and Play" system for simplified use. The upgraded model with "CleverClean" offers intelligent navigation suitable for all pool shapes, and the weekly timer function further optimizes cleaning.

However, it does have some minor drawbacks, such as its weight of 14 pounds, which can be a bit heavy to handle for some people, although its performance more than makes up for this slight inconvenience. In addition, the standard model is designed for pools up to 10 meters long, which can be limiting for larger pools.

In conclusion, despite these drawbacks, the Dolphin Nautilus CC is a wise choice for those looking for an effective and practical cleaning solution for their pool. It offers a combination of power, ease of use and advanced technology, making it the ideal assistant for maintaining a spotless pool.
