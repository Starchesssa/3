The sleep bar device is a white rectangular object that is used to amplify audio through your pillow. In the video different scenes of how the device operates are shown. This device is good for someone who may have trouble sleeping or wants to listen to audio while laying down. (Note for people with Low Vision, there is a small chime that can be heard when device turns on.)
