Title: DOUBLE adjustable bed! | Community Health TV - Ep 12

Description:
Did someone say DOUBLE adjustable beds?!

Yes, TWO adjustable beds in ONE! 🤯 You might wonder why we love this bed so much, and it is because it's sometimes the little things that can make a huge difference 💙

As you can see in the video, this bed gives people the option that if one person needs to elevate their feet through the night or raise their head, they can do that independently to their partner in the bed next to them.

Everyone has different care needs and preferences, so this is a wonderful solution to give each person their preference, depending on their care need, but still being able to be in bed together. So lovely 🥰

An #OccupationalTherapist is well placed to be able to assist and advise you on suitable bed options for your circumstances.

Once again, thank you so much Trish and Adjustacare for having us and showing us some of the many options that you have in store!
