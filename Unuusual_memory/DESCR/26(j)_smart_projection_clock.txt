Title: Amazon Review of Digital Talking Alarm Clock

Description:
This is a very neat digital talking alarm clock. In the video, you will see it and hear it. You will also see that I could almost set it up without the instructions. It takes three AAA batteries and they are not included.
This clock seems to do it all. Smart backlighting, 3 alarms, talking, great display and other options.
I do recommend it.
