Title: When You Sound Different on the Phone

Description:
It happens to the best of us. When a professional gives you a ring, be it a car insurance rep, accountant, doctor, student loan officer or credit card company, our voice somehow transforms into something otherworldly. Something that's not...you. And that's exactly what happens in the case of this video con Maruchi y Laritza.Â ðŸ“žðŸ“žðŸ“ž
