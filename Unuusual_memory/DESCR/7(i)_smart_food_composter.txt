Title: Coffee Compost | Homemade | Small Batch

Description:
Hi everyone,

Some of you have asked me how I make my coffee compose.  Here's a quick video.  Hope it helps.

I drink way too many espresso a day.  I just throw used coffee grind into small containers.  Usually have about 5 containers with compost in various stages.  Each month I will have 1 - 2 containers of compost ready for use on my plants.

1. Add coffee grind to container.
2. Add vegetable scraps and fruits peels.  Cut them into small pieces to breakdown faster.
3. Egg shells is ok.
4. NO ANIMAL PRODUCTS.
5. NO SEEDS.
6. Just keep adding for about 2 months or until container is full.  Leave it to do its' magic.  Give it a good mix every few days.
7. Make sure to have GOOD AIR CIRCULATION.
8. When it's ready, the compost will be fine and smell just like clean soil.  Content will reduced by about half in volume.
9. I normally use them after 3 months.
10. Apply directly to plants or mix with soil before adding.

Let me know if you have any question or suggestions.

Cheers +++
