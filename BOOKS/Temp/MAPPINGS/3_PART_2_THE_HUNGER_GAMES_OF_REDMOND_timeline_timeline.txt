1 | 0.00 --> 11.32 | a vector illustration style of a middle-aged male silhouette with a blank shadow head, wearing a business shirt, scratching his head in confusion. He stands in a vast, sterile corporate office with layers creating a 2.5D parallax effect. On the far wall, the glowing, dripping words 'TOXIC SYSTEM' are displayed prominently.
2 | 11.78 --> 14.26 | a vector illustration style of a male silhouette with a blank shadow head, dressed in a suit, shielding his face with his arms from an explosion of light. He is inside a corporate office that is cracking and imploding, with debris and papers flying in a 2.5D parallax depth effect. A large, cracked corporate logo is visible on a crumbling wall in the background.
3 | 14.78 --> 20.76 | a vector illustration style of a senior manager silhouette with a blank shadow head, in a sharp suit, looking down at a document. A single lightbulb above his head is shattered, symbolizing a bad idea. The 2.5D parallax background shows a large, ominous chart on the wall with the title 'STACK RANKING'.
4 | 21.62 --> 29.72 | a vector illustration style of a stressed manager silhouette with a blank shadow head, in a shirt and tie, being forced to write at his desk by a giant shadowy hand pressing down on his back. The 2.5D parallax background shows a large bell curve diagram on the cubicle wall with the words 'FORCED CURVE'.
5 | 30.32 --> 42.26 | a vector illustration style of a manager silhouette with a blank shadow head, wearing a blazer, reluctantly placing a large red 'X' over another employee silhouette. Two other employee silhouettes stand beside them. The 2.5D parallax background has three sections on the wall labeled 'TOP', 'AVERAGE', and 'POOR'.
6 | 42.94 --> 50.48 | a vector illustration style of a dejected male silhouette with a blank shadow head, in a casual shirt, carrying a cardboard box of his belongings. He has a large red 'X' marked on his back as he walks out of a brightly lit office door into a dark, deep hallway, creating a 2.5D parallax effect.
7 | 51.04 --> 65.88 | a vector illustration style of a manager silhouette with a blank shadow head, in a suit, kneeling in despair with his head in his hands. Before him stand five smaller, brightly glowing silhouettes. The 2.5D parallax background shows a giant, imposing stone tablet on the wall with the word 'POLICY' carved into it.
8 | 66.40 --> 73.36 | a vector illustration style of a manager silhouette with a blank shadow head, secretly holding a dagger behind his back while standing behind an unsuspecting employee silhouette. The 2.5D parallax background is a stark office wall with the word 'BRUTAL' scrawled in jagged red letters.
9 | 74.16 --> 82.02 | a vector illustration style of two male silhouettes with blank shadow heads, in business suits, standing back-to-back and looking suspiciously over their shoulders at each other. They are in an arena-like office space. The 2.5D parallax background wall features the large, ominous words 'HUNGER GAMES'.
10 | 82.56 --> 90.34 | a vector illustration style of two male silhouettes with blank shadow heads at adjacent desks. One reaches out for help, while the other turns away defensively, arms crossed. The 2.5D parallax background shows an office wall with the stark equation 'THEIR SUCCESS = MY FAILURE' written on it.
11 | 90.84 --> 95.78 | a vector illustration style of a male silhouette with a blank shadow head presenting at a screen, while another silhouette secretly unplugs a power cord from the wall behind him. The 2.5D parallax effect highlights the sneaky action, and the word 'SABOTAGE' flickers on the wall in the background.
12 | 96.56 --> 105.16 | a vector illustration style of several silhouettes with blank shadow heads around a boardroom table in a 2.5D parallax scene. One silhouette points an accusatory finger at another, who shrinks back. On the background wall, a spotlight illuminates the word 'CREDIT' while the word 'BLAME' is in deep shadow.
13 | 105.80 --> 115.92 | a vector illustration style of an authoritative male silhouette with a blank shadow head, in a suit, holding out his hand to display a crumbling, disintegrating cube. The 2.5D parallax background features a large, cracked, and decaying vintage Microsoft logo on the wall with the word 'DESTRUCTIVE' etched into it.
14 | 116.56 --> 123.92 | a vector illustration style of several male silhouettes with blank shadow heads in a workshop, meant to be building a complex machine but instead are tearing it apart and threatening each other with tools. The 2.5D parallax background wall shows a graph labeled 'INNOVATION' that is flatlined for a decade.
15 | 124.38 --> 132.76 | a vector illustration style of a line of silhouettes with blank shadow heads in a 2.5D parallax corridor. The first silhouette is an engineer holding a blueprint, but they progressively transform into paranoid politicians in suits. The corridor decays from clean to corroded, with the word 'CANCER' subtly integrated into the texture on the far wall.
