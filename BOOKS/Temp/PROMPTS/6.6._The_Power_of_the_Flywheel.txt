1.  A massive, dark grey metallic flywheel with glowing blue circuit-like lines, floating in a dark purple nebula background. Minimalist, clean lines.

2.  The same giant flywheel from prompt 1. A single, small, bright white arrow is pushing against its edge, causing a brilliant, crackling point of light and a slight, barely perceptible rotation.

3.  A sequence of three glowing arrows, each one pushing the flywheel. The wheel has a subtle, blue motion blur, indicating it's starting to spin.

4.  The flywheel is now spinning rapidly, creating a vibrant, circular trail of blue and white light. It has a powerful, glowing aura, suggesting self-sustained energy.

5.  The spinning flywheel is now a stylized, central icon. Below it, the abstract concept is labeled with clean, futuristic typography against a deep blue background with grid lines.

6.  A simple, glowing price tag icon with a bold, green arrow pointing down. From this icon, a stream of small, bright blue orbs flows outwards.

7.  A large cluster of blue orbs (customers) emits concentric, glowing rings. These rings attract a stream of smaller, orange hexagonal shapes (sellers) from the edge of the frame.

8.  A clean, minimalist pie chart. 97% of the circle is a solid, dark blue. A tiny, 3% sliver is highlighted in a vibrant, glowing orange, with a data label "3%" next to it.

9.  The same pie chart, but now the glowing orange section (sellers) dramatically takes up 58% of the circle, overpowering the dark blue section. A dynamic, upward-curving arrow visualizes the growth.

10. A vast, glowing grid of orange hexagons (sellers/selection) fills the center of the frame. From all sides, a massive influx of bright blue orbs (customers) is being drawn towards the grid.

11. A central, complex, pulsating blue geometric shape is expanding. As it grows, a connected infographic bar representing "Operating Costs" visibly shrinks, with a green downward arrow emphasizing the reduction.

12. A stylized, glowing cloud icon labeled "AWS" is connected to the main blue structure. From this cloud icon, a brilliant stream of golden particles flows outwards, representing massive revenue.

13. The stream of golden particles from the "AWS" cloud icon now forms an elegant arc, flowing directly into the glowing price tag icon from prompt 6. The green downward arrow on the price tag pulses brightly.

14. A visual summary of the loop: The supercharged price tag icon generates a massive river of blue orbs that flows in a circle, crashing into the edge of the flywheel, causing it to spin with a brilliant, white-hot glow.

15. A symmetrical infographic diagram. The effortlessly spinning flywheel is in the center. Around it are icons for 'Prices,' 'Customers,' 'Sellers,' and 'Selection.' Glowing lines of energy flow between them in a perfect, continuous, self-sustaining loop.
