**0.00 - 4.78:** A colossal, futuristic tech company headquarters building, overgrown with moss and vines, being pulled slowly by giant snails, cinematic lighting, hyper-realistic.

**5.58 - 11.32:** An abstract visualization of a corporate flowchart, where the lines are veins dripping with green toxic sludge and the boxes with job titles are corroding and melting, dark, ominous, digital art.

**11.78 - 14.26:** A massive glass skyscraper with a well-known corporate logo, with deep cracks spiderwebbing across its surface, glowing from within as if about to implode from immense internal pressure.

**14.78 - 20.76:** A vintage, demonic-looking machine made of brass and iron, labeled "THE STACK RANKER." The machine is sorting small, anonymous human figures into three chutes: "TOP," "AVERAGE," and "POOR." The "POOR" chute leads into a dark, smoky pit.

**23.74 - 29.72:** A manager with a stressed, horrified expression, standing in a dimly lit office, forced to brand employees with a glowing hot iron shaped like a bell curve.

**32.66 - 42.26:** A team of five brilliant, glowing employees working collaboratively on a futuristic project. A manager's hand, controlled by puppet strings leading up into the darkness, is forced to place a red "FAIL" sticker on the back of one of the glowing figures.

**46.46 - 50.48:** A line of anxious employees in a gray, monolithic office. A grim reaper figure wearing a corporate suit points a bony finger at one person, who begins to disintegrate into dust.

**59.34 - 65.88:** A manager sits at a desk, their hands bound by thick red tape that stretches out the window and attaches to the giant, faceless corporate building outside. On the desk is a single button under a glass case labeled "Label as Failure."

**66.40 - 71.78:** A powerful, symbolic image of a manager in a suit standing behind one of their best employees. The employee is radiating light, focused on their work. The manager's shadow on the wall behind them is distorted, showing them holding a dagger and poised to strike.

**74.16 - 79.72:** An office floor transformed into a brutalist, gladiatorial arena. Cubicles are crumbling ruins. Employees in torn business attire eye each other suspiciously, holding keyboards like weapons and hiding behind desks. The scene is captioned: "Corporate Hunger Games."

**80.90 - 87.72:** Two employees working at adjacent desks. A thick, thorny wall has grown up between them, separating them completely. Each is shielding their computer screen, peering paranoidly over the top of the wall at the other.

**90.84 - 95.78:** A dark office at night. A single spotlight illuminates an employee in a suit, sneakily pouring sand into the gears of a colleague's complex, glowing invention.

**96.56 - 105.16:** A corporate boardroom meeting depicted as a strategic game of chess. The executives are the chess pieces. One player points an accusatory finger, causing a harsh spotlight of "BLAME" to fall on another piece, while a golden orb of "CREDIT" materializes above their own head.

**116.56 - 118.72:** A magnificent, glowing tree labeled "INNOVATION." Its trunk and branches are being choked by thick, dark, thorny vines labeled "STACK RANKING." The tree's leaves are wilting, and its light is fading.

**124.38 - 132.76:** A cross-section of a gleaming, high-tech corporate building. At its very core is a dark, spreading cancerous mass with pulsing veins. These dark veins creep up through the floors, and where they touch the brilliant, glowing figures of engineers, the figures transform into shadowy, cloaked politicians holding daggers.
