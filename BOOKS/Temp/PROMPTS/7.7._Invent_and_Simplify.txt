1. Kurzgesagt style infographic. On the left, a complex, tangled knot of glowing, multi-colored neon lines representing 'invention'. A clean, futuristic white arrow points to the right. On the right, a single, perfectly smooth, glowing blue sphere representing 'simplicity'. Dark, deep space background.

2. Kurzgesagt style. An abstract, futuristic engine made of interconnected glowing geometric shapesâ€”cubes, spheres, and cylinders. Bright energy pulses flow through transparent pipelines connecting the parts. Vibrant purples, oranges, and blues against a dark navy background.

3. Kurzgesagt style. The abstract, futuristic engine from the previous image, now framed by a glowing, minimalist holographic bracket. The word 'INVENTION' is displayed in a clean, sans-serif font within the bracket's glow. The background remains dark and atmospheric.

4. Kurzgesagt style. In the foreground, a single, minimalist, glowing keyhole emitting a soft light. A bright, curved line of energy travels from the keyhole into the background, where the complex abstract engine is now activated and glowing brightly. The focus is on the simple keyhole.

5. Kurzgesagt style. A large, stylized cloud icon made of interconnected glowing dots and lines, representing a digital network. In the center of the cloud, the letters 'AWS' shine brightly in a vibrant orange and blue gradient. Deep blue space background.

6. Kurzgesagt style infographic. A vast, sprawling grid of interconnected, glowing server racks or data cubes stretching into the distance. In the center, a single, illuminated icon of a shopping cart, with glowing data streams flowing from the entire network and converging on it.

7. Kurzgesagt style. The same massive grid of glowing data cubes from the previous image. Now, bright, colorful streams of data are flowing outwards from the grid to numerous smaller, diverse geometric shapes (spheres, pyramids, cubes) scattered around the periphery, representing various businesses.

8. Kurzgesagt style. A minimalist, glowing lightbulb icon at the center of the frame. Instead of a filament, a powerful, bright starburst of light erupts from its core, sending concentric shockwaves of color across a dark background, representing a revolutionary idea.

9. Kurzgesagt style infographic. A simple, glowing pie chart. A large, dominant slice, making up 80% of the circle, is colored bright red and has a minimalist server rack icon inside it. The smaller, 20% slice is a calm blue. The visual focus is on the overwhelming red slice.

10. Kurzgesagt style. The large red server slice from the pie chart is shown shrinking dramatically. A clean arrow points from it to two simple, glowing icons on the right: a futuristic mouse cursor clicking a button, and a minimalist credit card icon. The background is clean and bright.

11. Kurzgesagt style infographic. Two vertical bar graphs side-by-side on a dark background. The left bar, labeled 'SALES', has a small 16% segment glowing in a bright orange. The right bar, labeled 'PROFIT', has a very large 67% segment glowing in the same bright orange, creating a dramatic visual contrast.

12. Kurzgesagt style. A single, large, glowing circular button dominates the center of the frame. Inside the button is the text '1-Click' in a clean, bold font. A stylized, minimalist mouse cursor is poised just above the button, emitting a soft light.

13. Kurzgesagt style infographic. A flow diagram showing 100 small, glowing orbs moving from left to right. They encounter a complex, tangled maze of lines representing a checkout process. 70 of the orbs are shown falling off the path into a dark abyss below, while only 30 successfully exit on the right.

14. Kurzgesagt style infographic. The same starting line of 100 glowing orbs from the previous image. The tangled maze is replaced by a single, shining '1-Click' button. A clean, bright line passes straight through the button, and all 100 orbs are shown successfully reaching the destination on the right side.
