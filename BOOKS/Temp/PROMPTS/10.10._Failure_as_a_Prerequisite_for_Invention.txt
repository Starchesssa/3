1. Ten glowing, colorful cubes in a horizontal line on a dark background, with a futuristic arrow cursor pointing at the first cube. Kurzgesagt style, vibrant infographic, minimalist.

2. A row of ten abstract blocks. Nine are dull grey and crumbling. The tenth block glows with an intense gold light, with a massive, towering column of light and energy exploding upwards from it, dwarfing the others. Kurzgesagt infographic style, high contrast.

3. A central, glowing orb with a stylized, minimalist arrow logo on it. From this orb, multiple pathways of light branch out, some leading to faded, broken shapes and one leading to a bright, complex structure. Kurzgesagt style, abstract representation of a philosophy.

4. A simple, abstract flowchart. A series of dark, shattered lightbulb icons are linked by glowing arrows, leading to a single, brilliantly illuminated and perfectly formed lightbulb at the end. Vibrant colors, minimalist infographic, Kurzgesagt style.

5. A stylized, glowing, geometric block representing a smartphone, seen from an isometric perspective. A simple, abstract flame icon hovers over its screen. The object is the central focus on a dark, clean background. Kurzgesagt style, minimalist tech diagram.

6. The abstract smartphone block is shown at the bottom of the frame. A massive flow of glowing, colorful particles representing resources is being funneled into it from above. A large, stylized upward arrow indicates its launch. Kurzgesagt infographic.

7. The stylized smartphone block is now cracking and breaking apart into dozens of smaller, dull-colored geometric fragments. A large, red, downward-trending graph line dominates the background. Kurzgesagt style, high contrast, visual metaphor for failure.

8. A vast, isometric grid filled with countless grey, lifeless versions of the stylized smartphone block. In the center, a huge, glowing red block labeled with "-$170M" presses down on the grid, causing it to buckle. Abstract infographic, Kurzgesagt style.

9. A clean, futuristic stock market graph with a glowing line. The line suddenly plummets, creating a deep valley. The downward slope is highlighted in a vibrant, alarming red, with the label "-8%" next to it. Minimalist data visualization, Kurzgesagt style.

10. Two large, abstract icons on a dark background. On the left, a broken, glowing coin symbol. On the right, a stylized eye symbol with a bold red 'X' through it. Both icons are cracked and dim. Kurzgesagt style, simple symbolic representation.

11. A dark screen with a large, red, solid period symbol in the center. A bright, colorful crack appears in the period, with beams of light shining out from within. Kurzgesagt style, dramatic reveal, visual metaphor.

12. Glowing fragments from a shattered block are being pulled into a central vortex of light. The fragments reassemble and transform into a new shape: a sleek, minimalist cylinder. A pulsating blue orb of energy forms at the top of the cylinder. Kurzgesagt infographic style.

13. The abstract cylinder is in the center, glowing intensely. From it, massive, vibrant waves of energy and data radiate outwards, covering the entire background. A large, bright green arrow points sharply upwards behind it. Kurzgesagt style, dynamic visual of success.

14. A simple, clean infographic pie chart. One massive segment, colored in a brilliant, glowing blue and taking up over half the circle, is labeled "60%". The small remaining segment is fragmented into multiple dull colors. Minimalist data visualization, Kurzgesagt style.

15. A futuristic, glowing balance scale. On the small, high-up side is a single, dim red cube labeled "-$170M". On the other side, weighed down heavily, is a massive, towering stack of brightly glowing gold bars. Kurzgesagt style, abstract financial comparison.

16. A complex network of glowing pathways branching out from a central point. Many of the paths end in small, dim, fizzled-out sparks. One long, winding path continues on, leading to a massive, brilliantly shining, complex geometric star. Infographic showing the necessity of many experimental paths, Kurzgesagt style.
