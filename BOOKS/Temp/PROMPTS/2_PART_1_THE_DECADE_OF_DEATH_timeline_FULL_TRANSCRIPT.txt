**(0:00 - 5:56)**
A slow, ominous zoom into the modern, gleaming Microsoft campus sign, but the image is desaturated and grainy, hinting at decay. The name "Satya Nadella" is typed out slowly over the image.

**(6:34 - 14:52)**
Quick-cut archival montage of the 90s: the Windows 95 startup sound echoes, shots of people unboxing huge CRT monitors, the classic Windows logo triumphantly hovering over a spinning globe like a satellite. The final shot is a massive, impenetrable fortress with the Windows flag flying high.

**(15:12 - 27:02)**
The fortress shot freezes. A digital glitch effect crackles across the screen. Cut to a stark, clean line graph showing Microsoft's stock price from 2001-2011. The line is perfectly, unnervingly flat. The camera pans slowly across the entire length of the flat line.

**(27:02 - 37:18)**
Split screen. On the left, the flat Microsoft stock graph remains static. On the right, a rapid-fire montage of innovation explodes: a hand holding the iconic white iPod click wheel, Steve Jobs revealing the first iPhone, a blur of Google search results filling a screen. The Microsoft side of the screen slowly fades to a shot of a vast, empty, sterile corporate hallway, capturing the feeling of a "ghost."

**(39:68 - 57:62)**
Archival footage of Steve Ballmer on stage, sweating, screaming "Developers, developers, developers!" The video is intercut with visuals of a powerful, chaotic nuclear reactor core glowing intensely. Then, a shot of Ballmer looking lovingly at a Windows logo, so closely that it's the only thing in his field of vision, everything else blurred out—his "blind spot."

**(58:04 - 69:26)**
An animation of a golden goose sitting on a pile of gold coins labeled "Windows." Giant stone walls rise up around the goose, protecting it. As the walls build higher, they cast a deep shadow, and we see tiny figures representing "mobile," "search," and "social media" walking away, ignored, outside the walls.

**(69:94 - 82:08)**
A dramatic visual metaphor: a sentry in Microsoft armor stands guard on the castle wall, staring intently inwards at the golden goose. The camera pulls back dramatically to reveal the entire castle is on a small island, and in the distance, a massive, vibrant new continent teeming with cities labeled "Apple," "Google," and "Facebook" has risen from the sea. The sentry hasn't noticed.

**(82:90 - 92:62)**
A single hand holding up the first iPhone. The screen illuminates a dark room. The light from the phone screen expands, dissolving the old Microsoft castle into pixels.

**(93:30 - 108:82)**
A shot of the colorful Windows Phone tile interface. The tiles begin to crack and fall off a wall, revealing only a tiny 3% of the wall is covered. The remaining 97% is a solid wall dominated by the Android and iOS logos. A referee slams his hand down on a mat: "It was over."

**(110:70 - 113:68)**
An overhead shot of a massive office bullpen. Hundreds of employees sit at their desks, but they are all moving in slow motion, their faces despondent. Papers droop from their hands. A single crumpled piece of paper falls into a waste bin in slow motion.

**(114:20 - 130:14)**
A fast, comedic, failing montage: A hand tries to plug a Zune music player into an iPod dock where it doesn't fit. Someone throws a plate of spaghetti (representing random products) at a wall to see what sticks, but it all just slides down into a mess. Close-up on the roots of a massive old tree (Microsoft) showing them slowly decaying and turning to dust.

**(131:06 - 136:30)**
A final, dramatic shot. A silhouette of a huge, hollowed-out corporate building. In the center, where a heart should be, there is just an empty, dark space. The narrator says, "a company in need of a soul," and a single, faint light begins to glow in the empty space.
