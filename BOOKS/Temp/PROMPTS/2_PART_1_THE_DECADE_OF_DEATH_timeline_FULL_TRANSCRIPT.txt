1. (0.00-9.32) - A 2D parallax image showing a male silhouette looking down at a flat, unchanging stock graph on a screen. In the background, a massive, imposing corporate building with the Microsoft logo looms, appearing powerful but stagnant. The overall tone is somber and dark.

2. (9.32-15.12) - A powerful 3D parallax image of a male silhouette standing confidently on top of a globe made of glowing circuit boards. The globe is orbited by countless computer monitors, all displaying the classic Windows logo, signifying total market dominance.

3. (15.12-27.92) - A stark image of a calendar with its pages for "2001" through "2011" being torn away, revealing the exact same flat stock market line underneath each page. A male silhouette sits dejectedly beside the unchanging graph, emphasizing a decade of stagnation.

4. (27.92-38.58) - A 3D parallax scene. In the vibrant foreground, two silhouettes celebrate with new devices (representing Apple's iPod and iPhone) and another uses a glowing search bar (representing Google). In the distant, faded background, a large, semi-transparent silhouette representing Microsoft stands motionless and ghost-like.

5. (38.58-51.68) - A dynamic 2D parallax image of a male silhouette on a stage, arms wide, mouth open in a passionate shout. Stylized words "DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPERS" radiate from him like sound waves over a crowd of other silhouettes in the foreground.

6. (51.68-69.26) - A male silhouette is shown with his back to the viewer, obsessively polishing a large, glowing "Golden Goose" that has the Windows logo on it. In the background, clear opportunities represented by icons for mobile phones, search, and social media are fading into the darkness, completely unnoticed by him.

7. (69.26-82.08) - A 3D parallax image showing a male silhouette standing inside a tall, fortified castle with a "Windows" flag. He is looking inward, guarding the castle, while outside the walls and across a vast chasm, a new, brightly lit continent bustles with the activity of a modern, mobile world.

8. (82.08-92.62) - The silhouette from the previous scene now looks out from his crumbling castle walls in shock. A massive tidal wave, with the clear shape of a modern smartphone at its crest, is about to crash down on him, symbolizing the disruptive arrival of the iPhone.

9. (92.62-108.82) - A 2D parallax image of a racetrack. Two sleek silhouettes representing Android and iOS are celebrating at the finish line. Far behind them, a third silhouette representing the Windows Phone has stumbled and fallen, with a scoreboard in the background showing a pathetic "3%".

10. (108.82-120.08) - An office scene with a low-morale atmosphere. A male silhouette sits at his desk, head in his hands. On the desk is a clunky, failed music player (representing the Zune), and a wastebasket next to him is overflowing with discarded product blueprints.

11. (120.08-130.14) - A male silhouette is frantically throwing darts at a wall, but all of them miss the target. In the background, the foundation of the large corporate building from the first image is shown with deep, glowing cracks, symbolizing the core business rotting from within.

12. (130.14-136.30) - A final, poignant 3D parallax image. A single, small male silhouette stands at the base of a massive, hollowed-out corporate building. He looks up into the building's core, which is an empty, dark void where its "soul" should be.
