1. (94.38 - 98.04) - A 2D parallax scene showing two male silhouettes in business suits standing on opposite sides of a chasm. One silhouette is on the left, the other on the right, representing rival companies. Between them, in the mid-ground, abstract icons representing creative software (like a stylized pen tool, a camera lens, and a paintbrush) float in the air. The background is a simple, corporate blue gradient.

2. (98.38 - 99.90) - A 3D parallax image where the two rival male silhouettes from the previous scene are now in the foreground, meeting in the middle to shake hands. Behind them, in the background, a large, glowing, stylized cloud icon materializes. The chasm that previously separated them is now gone, replaced by a solid bridge.

3. (100.40 - 101.40) - A close-up 2D parallax shot focusing on a single, central male silhouette at a modern desk. His hand is in the foreground, signing a glowing, digital contract on a tablet. In the blurred background, several other indistinct male silhouettes stand, suggesting a series of partnerships and deals being made.
