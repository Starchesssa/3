(behind scenes) - recreate the iconic PayPal Mafia group photo with faceless high-fashion 3d silhouettes of male business figures in a futuristic server room, their shadowed forms clustered together in a conspiratorial pose, and (tiny side) - have the entire scene illuminated by the dramatic blue and white light of a single, powerful server rack glowing with the Microsoft Azure logo.

(poured gasoline) - recreate the iconic 1999 photo of Jeff Bezos in his office, but instead feature a single, high-fashion male silhouette with a hidden face standing proudly, and (billions dollars) - on the wall behind the figure, have the word 'AZURE' spray-painted in a raw, dripping Microsoft blue, as if marking a new territory, and (massive painful) - have the entire stark room lit by the overwhelming blue and white glow from a massive window showing a futuristic Microsoft data center under construction.

(declared that) - recreate the iconic 2007 image of Steve Jobs introducing the iPhone, with a single high-fashion male silhouette on a vast, dark stage, his face hidden in shadow, and (cloud-first mobile-first) - have the figure dramatically underlit by intense Microsoft blue and white stage lights, gesturing towards a giant screen behind him, and (engine that) - the screen should display not a device, but a colossal, glowing, abstract visualization of the Microsoft Azure cloud, depicted as a powerful engine pulsing with energy.
