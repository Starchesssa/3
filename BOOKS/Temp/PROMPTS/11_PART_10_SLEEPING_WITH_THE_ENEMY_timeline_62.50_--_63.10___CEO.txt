Between them, a jagged red line glows, symbolizing a deep and bitter rivalry. The background is a stylized, dark corporate office overlooking a city at night.

2. (6.94-11.40) - A dynamic 2D/3D parallax scene. The two male silhouettes are now depicted as chess players leaning intensely over a glowing, translucent chessboard. One silhouette is in the middle of an aggressive move, representing fierce competition. The chess pieces are abstract shapes representing corporate assets and market share.

3. (11.40-16.92) - A 2D/3D parallax image focused on the concept of "customer relationship management." A central, large silhouette of a customer is surrounded by a network of glowing lines.
