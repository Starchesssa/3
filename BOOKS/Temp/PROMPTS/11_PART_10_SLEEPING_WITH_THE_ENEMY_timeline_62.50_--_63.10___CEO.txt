**62.50:** A sleek, minimalist lower third graphic fades in. Text: "CEO, Microsoft". The font is modern and clean, set against a blurred background of a bustling tech campus.

**63.32:** A high-quality, professional photograph of Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, on stage at a conference. He is gesturing passionately, with the iconic blue Salesforce cloud logo visible on a large screen behind him.

**64.46:** A powerful, symbolic image. The Microsoft logo and the Salesforce logo are depicted as two opposing chess pieces, a king and a queen, on a glass chessboard. The shot is dramatic, with low-key lighting and a shallow depth of field, focusing on the tension between the two pieces.

**66.20:** A metaphorical visual of two fencers in dark business suits lunging and parrying on a stark, minimalist stage. Instead of foils, they wield glowing batons of light—one in Microsoft's corporate blue, the other in Salesforce's lighter blue. Sparks fly where the light-swords clash.

**68.10:** An abstract, futuristic data visualization. A glowing, 3D holographic sphere representing the global market. Two powerful streams of data, one blue and one cyan, flow into it, competing to connect with millions of smaller nodes representing customers. The text "Customer Relationship Management" is subtly embedded in the data streams.
