1. A simple garage icon appears, and a small, glowing cube with a gear symbol inside pops out and floats upwards.
2. A flat, stylized magazine cover with a large letter "T" slides into view. A golden star icon animates onto the cover.
3. The screen splits. On the left, the magazine remains. On the right, a red, jagged line graph plummets downwards, next to a cartoon bomb icon labeled "Amazon.bomb".
4. A red speech bubble filled with a skull-and-crossbones icon pops out from the "Amazon.bomb" icon.
5. The split screen merges, and a simple, abstract block labeled "Bezos" appears in the center, pulsing gently.
6. A minimalist book icon appears. It flips open, and a stream of smaller icons (a book, a musical note, a joystick) flows out.
7. The stream of icons arranges itself into a large, fortress-like structure on a blueprint background. A crown icon pops onto the top tower.
8. A simple telescope icon appears and looks across the screen. A dotted line extends from it, passing over several small, jagged hurdles and aiming at a distant, glowing star.
9. The camera zooms into the blueprint from sentence 7, following a glowing, highlighted path that connects key points of the structure.
10. KEY LESSON: PLAY THE LONG GAME WHEN EVERYONE ELSE IS PLAYING THE SHORT ONE. On the left, a small set of dominoes falls over quickly. On the right, a single, large lever is pulled slowly, revealing a long, winding path that lights up towards a distant treasure chest icon.
