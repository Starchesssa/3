Here are 11 image prompts in the style of Kurzgesagt for each sentence:

1.  A minimalist, glowing compass on a dark purple background. The needle is a bright, vibrant arrow pointing directly at a single, luminous, stylized icon representing a customer. The compass is sleek and futuristic.

2.  An abstract flowchart with two diverging paths. One path, dim and gray, points inward to a complex gear icon. The other path, bright and glowing in turquoise, points outward to a luminous, stylized customer icon. The bright path is highlighted.

3.  A sleek, dark rectangular block, representing a product. From its surface, several flashy, holographic, geometric prisms and complex shapes emerge, glowing in neon pink and cyan. These shapes are disconnected and float aimlessly.

4.  The glowing holographic prisms from the previous image are moving towards the luminous customer icon. The customer icon emits a soft, transparent barrier or force field that repels the shapes, showing a clear mismatch.

5.  A large, imposing, solid block with the number "$199" embossed on it. The block acts as a wall, looking heavy and insurmountable. The background is a stark, clean gradient.

6.  A dramatic, stylized line graph showing a steep, cliff-like drop. The line, glowing brightly in red-orange, starts high on the left and plummets almost to the bottom on the right, ending at a small glowing "99Â¢" label.

7.  The sleek, dark rectangular block from the earlier image is exploding into hundreds of small, geometric shards. The explosion is a silent, stylized burst of vibrant, chaotic colors against a dark background.

8.  A large, glowing stack of stylized rectangular blocks representing money. A significant portion of the stack is dissolving into dust particles and blowing away to the side. The dissolving section is highlighted with a simple text overlay: "-$170M".

9.  A single, small, glowing red domino tipping over and causing a chain reaction that topples a much larger, intricate structure made of blue blocks. A large arrow points down next to the collapsed structure with "-20%" beside it.

10. The geometric shards of the exploded product are slowly being pulled back together by glowing lines of light that originate from the stylized customer icon. The pieces are reassembling into a new, simpler shape that fits perfectly into a glowing outline projected by the customer icon.

11. A vast, dark blue and purple cosmic background. In the exact center, a single, brilliantly glowing, multi-pointed star shines brightly. All other faint, abstract elements in the scene have subtle lines of light connecting them to this central star.
