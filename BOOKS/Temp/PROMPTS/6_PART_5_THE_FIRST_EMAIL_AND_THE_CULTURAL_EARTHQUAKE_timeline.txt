1. (0.00 - 9.22) - a geometric vector illustration style of a middle-aged silhouette of a new CEO, with an angular no-face head and short hair, wearing a sharp business suit. He stands confidently on a stage, looking up towards a bright light. In the parallax background, a massive, glowing Microsoft logo is projected onto a futuristic screen.

2. (9.94 - 16.20) - a geometric vector illustration style of a group of silhouettes in business attire, with angular no-face heads, huddled together whispering and pointing with questioning gestures towards a single, calm silhouette of an engineer in the distance. The parallax background is dark and filled with large, floating, glowing question marks.

3. (16.86 - 27.70) - a geometric vector illustration style of a lone CEO silhouette with an angular no-face head, sitting at a minimalist desk in a dark room, illuminated only by the glow of his laptop screen. Glowing lines emanate from the screen, spreading outwards to thousands of points, representing the mass email in a parallax effect.

4. (28.14 - 36.22) - a geometric vector illustration style of large, iconic vector logos for 'Google' and 'Apple' cracking and falling apart as if shaken by a violent earthquake. In the foreground, the word 'Windows' is faded and ignored. The scene has a dramatic, parallax depth with dust and debris.

5. (36.64 - 46.74) - a geometric vector illustration style of a silhouette with an angular no-face head, turning its back on a crumbling pillar labeled 'TRADITION' and reaching towards a brightly glowing lightbulb. The parallax background features the word 'INNOVATION' softly glowing.

6. (47.32 - 62.86) - a geometric vector illustration style of several business silhouettes with angular no-face heads in a dark, oppressive boardroom. They are aggressively posturing, puffing their chests out and arguing. The phrase 'KNOW IT ALLS' is scrawled on the back wall in a bold, imposing font with a parallax effect.

7. (63.36 - 77.56) - a geometric vector illustration style of a group of silhouettes with angular no-face heads, collaborating around a table in a bright room. One silhouette has its hands up in a gesture of not knowing, while another pats them on the back supportively. In the bright parallax background, the words 'LEARN IT ALLS' are written in a welcoming font.

8. (78.02 - 89.06) - a geometric vector illustration style of a CEO silhouette with an angular no-face head, wearing a suit and stumbling on a tightrope high above a chasm. Below him, the words 'STACK RANKING' are crumbling into dust. The scene is tense, with a deep parallax effect showing the long fall.

9. (89.48 - 106.94) - a geometric vector illustration style of a central CEO silhouette with an angular no-face head, cowering as he is bombarded by a storm of red, downward-pointing arrows. In the parallax background, the word 'DISASTER' is shown in a fractured, glitching font.

10. (107.54 - 120.00) - a geometric vector illustration style of a CEO silhouette with an angular no-face head, turning his back on a monolithic, cracking wall and decisively stepping through an open, glowing doorway with the word 'WRONG' above it. The parallax effect shows the path ahead is uncertain but bright.

11. (120.52 - 135.70) - a geometric vector illustration style of a lone CEO silhouette with an angular no-face head, bowing his head respectfully in a gesture of apology. His large shadow on the floor behind him is shaped like a crown, which he is stepping away from. In the parallax background, the single word 'OWNED' is displayed in a clean, strong font.

12. (136.26 - 153.74) - a geometric vector illustration style of a leading silhouette with an angular no-face head, from which a gentle, glowing ripple expands outwards across a sea of other employee silhouettes who are looking up with hope. The parallax background shows a sun rising over a city skyline, with the words 'CHANGE BEGUN' illuminated by its rays.
