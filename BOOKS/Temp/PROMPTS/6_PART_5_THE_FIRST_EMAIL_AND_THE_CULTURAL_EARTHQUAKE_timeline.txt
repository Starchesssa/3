1.(0.00-9.22)- A 2D male silhouette, representing Satya Nadella, rises onto a central podium under a spotlight. The iconic Microsoft logo glows softly in the background. News headlines and camera flashes animate around him.

2.(9.94-16.20)- A close-up on the silhouette of Nadella's head. Inside, animated gears are turning. The camera pulls back to show a crowd of other silhouettes with large, glowing question marks floating above their heads, all looking towards him.

3.(16.86-21.90)- A split-screen animation. On the left, a silhouette stands on a stage amidst flashing cameras. On the right, a silhouette dramatically unveils a glowing product. A large red "X" is animated, crossing out both scenes simultaneously.

4.(22.34-30.48)- A parallax scene. In the foreground, a single silhouette types at a desk. An email icon flies from the screen. In the background, which moves more slowly, the email icon multiplies and flies toward a vast sea of thousands of employee silhouettes. The ground beneath them cracks and trembles like an earthquake.

5.(31.16-36.22)- An animation showing a document. The logos for Google, Apple, and Windows appear on the page. A silhouette hand enters the frame and waves them away, causing them to fade out completely.

6.(36.64-40.72)- A silhouette of a human head shown in profile. The camera zooms in, and inside the head, a glowing heart (empathy) and a slowly turning page of a book (learning) are illuminated.

7.(41.26-46.74)- A parallax effect scene. In the foreground, an ancient, crumbling pillar labeled "TRADITION" falls apart. In the background, several silhouettes work together to build a sleek, glowing, modern skyscraper labeled "INNOVATION".

8.(47.32-56.88)- A group of 2D male silhouettes are in a boardroom. Their heads are depicted as rigid, closed boxes. The words "KNOW-IT-ALLS" are stamped over the scene in a bold, hard font.

9.(56.88-66.74)- A silhouette stands alone in a spotlight, looking stressed. Other silhouettes in the shadows point at him. A large silhouette hand sweeps across the screen, shattering the entire "know-it-all" scene into pieces.

10.(67.22-77.56)- A new scene fades in, showing several silhouettes working collaboratively. One has a question mark over its head, and another helps a fallen colleague up. Where the silhouette fell, a small plant begins to grow. The words "LEARN-IT-ALLS" appear in a soft, growing font.

11.(78.02-83.88)- Silhouettes stand on a tiered pyramid representing "stack ranking." A silhouette near the top is shown pushing another one off, while two others are shown with daggers behind their backs. The entire pyramid structure then cracks and crumbles to dust.

12.(84.54-94.90)- A silhouette of Nadella sits on a stage under a spotlight, across from an interviewer silhouette who has a large question mark in a speech bubble.

13.(95.60-103.56)- From Nadella's silhouette, a speech bubble emerges containing a confusing flowchart labeled "THE SYSTEM" and a lotus flower labeled "KARMA." The background turns dark and stormy.

14.(104.04-114.34)- A split-screen. On the left, a silhouette stands defensively behind a brick wall. On the right, Nadella's silhouette turns and walks down a completely different, open path as angry social media icons fly past in the foreground with a parallax effect.

15.(114.80-120.00)- The silhouette of Nadella is at a desk again, typing frantically. An email icon shoots from his screen. The email has the words "I WAS WRONG" written on it in bold letters.

16.(120.52-129.42)- A close-up on a computer screen where a silhouette hand is typing a message. The phrase "completely incorrectly" is highlighted in red, then deleted and replaced with the phrase "committed to advance" in green.

17.(130.00-142.20)- Nadella's silhouette stands in the center. He points to himself, then holds out an open hand. A glowing, open book appears above his head, and its light spreads outwards, causing glowing books to appear above the heads of all the surrounding silhouettes.

18.(142.70-153.74)- A parallax animation. A silhouette wearing a slightly crooked crown is in the foreground. He humbly adjusts it. From this action, a single ripple of light emanates, traveling into the background and transforming a rigid grid pattern into a fluid, organic one.
