1. (0.00-9.22) - A lone 3D angular character, head tilted upward accepting a new role, is illuminated by a single beam of light on a vast, dark stage with floating holographic logos in parallax.
2. (9.22-21.90) - A central 3D geometric character stands calmly while being surrounded by other angular figures leaning in with skeptical, questioning poses, silhouetted against a neon-drenched cyberpunk cityscape in parallax.
3. (21.90-30.48) - A 3D angular character sits with one hand over a glowing interface, unleashing massive geometric shockwaves that crack the dark, minimalist environment around them in parallax.
4. (30.48-46.74) - A lone 3D character walks calmly with open hands between two massive, glitching titans frozen in mid-battle, set against a ruined digital arena with floating code in parallax.
5. (46.74-66.74) - A 3D angular character makes a sharp, downward chopping motion with their hand, causing a group of arrogant, statuesque figures in the background to shatter into geometric fragments inside a sterile, deconstructing grid room in parallax.
6. (66.74-83.88) - A 3D geometric character kneels with a humble, curious pose, assembling glowing shards of data in a dark void filled with swirling fragments and abstract information streams in parallax.
7. (83.88-106.94) - A single 3D angular character recoils defensively, arms raised as they are bombarded by a storm of sharp, red geometric shards representing brutal backlash, within a dark digital arena in parallax.
8. (106.94-124.26) - A 3D geometric character stands with its head bowed and one hand over its chest in a pose of sincere apology, set against a stark, minimalist environment with a single focused spotlight in parallax.
9. (124.26-153.74) - A central 3D character stands in an open, welcoming pose, sending out glowing ripples of light that transform the rigid stances of other figures around them, signaling a massive cultural shift in a vast, dark space with expanding light networks in parallax.
