1.(0.00-9.22)- A close-up on a calendar page. The pages flip violently, papers flying towards the screen, landing on "FEBRUARY 4, 2014". The camera pulls back through the date, revealing a stark, minimalist Microsoft boardroom. In the center, a lone 3D male silhouette stands under a single spotlight. In the background, through a massive window, the blurred, sprawling Microsoft campus is visible at dusk. A "Breaking News" ticker scrolls across the bottom of the frame: "SATYA NADELLA NAMED THIRD CEO OF MICROSOFT".

2.(9.22-16.20)- A dynamic grid of dozens of monitors, like a stock market trading floor. Each screen shows a different 2D male silhouette of a tech analyst or journalist, their posture conveying shock and curiosity. The foreground is filled with the glare and reflection off the screens. Data streams and glowing question marks flash across the grid. In the central, largest monitor, we see the same unassuming silhouette of Nadella from the previous shot, with the words "THE QUIET ENGINEER?" typed out and blinking beside him.

3.(16.20-21.90)- A stark split-screen. On the left, a bulky silhouette of a CEO is on a huge stage, arms raised triumphantly under blinding spotlights, with camera flashes popping in the foreground. In the background, a massive crowd of silhouettes cheers. On the right, in a dimly lit, quiet office, Nadella's silhouette sits calmly, hands on a keyboard. A giant, stylized red "X" is graphically stamped over the left scene, which then freezes.

4.(21.90-30.48)- An extreme close-up of a computer monitor. The text of an email is being composed. The camera focuses on the "To:" field, where the recipient count "100,000+" rapidly scrolls and locks in. The silhouette's finger clicks "SEND". The instant it's clicked, the entire screen fractures like glass, with digital cracks spreading outwards from the center. The parallax effect shows the cracks in the foreground, the email text behind them, and in the deep background, a digital map of the world where Microsoft office locations light up as the seismic shockwave hits them.

5.(30.48-36.22)- A rapid, aggressive montage. First, a silhouette of a gladiator crushes a glowing Apple logo with a hammer, the fragments flying towards the camera. Second, a silhouette punches through a Google logo, causing it to shatter. Third, the iconic Windows logo disintegrates into dust. Each quick shot is stamped with a glitchy, red, stenciled text overlay: "NO MORE WAR."

6.(36.22-46.74)- A clean, white, abstract space. Two 2D male silhouettes face each other. One's head is a complex mess of old, rusty gears labeled "TRADITION." The other's head is a glowing, fluid neural network labeled "INNOVATION." In the foreground, the quote "Our industry does not respect tradition. It only respects innovation" types itself onto the screen in a crisp, modern font. The word "EMPATHY" glows softly between the two figures.

7.(46.74-56.88)- A cold, metallic boardroom. Several 3D male silhouettes with oversized, polished chrome heads are seated around a long table, all talking at once. Their speech bubbles are filled with complex code and corporate jargon, chaotically overlapping. In the foreground, a glass of water on the table reflects the distorted, argumentative scene. The background shows the imposing, rigid architecture of the old Microsoft campus through a window.

8.(56.88-66.74)- The same boardroom scene. Nadella's silhouette stands at the head of the table. He makes a single, sharp chopping motion with his hand. In response, the chrome heads of the other silhouettes crack and crumble into metallic dust. The words "KNOW-IT-ALL" appear in huge, stone letters in the foreground before exploding into fragments that fly past the camera.

9.(66.74-77.56)- The dust from the previous scene swirls and reforms into new silhouettes. Their heads are now transparent spheres, and inside each, a "learn-it-all" neural network pulses with light. Glowing lines of data connect them as they collaborate. One silhouette raises its hand, and a bright question mark appears above its head. In the foreground, particles of light drift by, while in the background, a bright, abstract digital horizon emerges.

10.(77.56-89.06)- A dark, oppressive office hallway. Rows of 2D silhouettes representing employees are arranged in a "stack ranking" chart on the wall. The silhouettes at the bottom of the chart fade into nothingness. The scene dissolves to Nadella's silhouette alone on a vast, dark stage, caught in a single, harsh spotlight. He stumbles, and the spotlight turns an accusatory red. The background is a blurred sea of thousands of judgmental, faceless silhouettes.

11.(89.06-106.94)- The view from behind the silhouette on stage. A tidal wave of angry red social media icons and negative headlines ("DISASTER," "TONE DEAF") rushes towards him from the background, engulfing the screen. The phrases "GOOD KARMA" and "TRUST THE SYSTEM" appear in the foreground as brittle glass text, then are instantly shattered by the incoming digital storm.

12.(106.94-120.00)- Split screen. On the left, titled "OLD MICROSOFT," a defiant silhouette stands behind a fortress-like podium, arms crossed. On the right, "NEW MICROSOFT," Nadella's silhouette sits at a simple desk, head slightly bowed, typing. The camera zooms in on his screen, where the words "I was completely wrong" glow with intense white light. As he hits send, the fortress on the left visibly cracks.

13.(120.00-135.70)- An intimate close-up on the silhouette's hands typing at a keyboard. Key words from his apology—"INCORRECTLY," "COMMITTED," "LEARN"—are highlighted as they are typed. The camera slowly pulls back. He is no longer on a stage but in a simple office. He lifts his head and looks directly forward with quiet resolve. In the foreground, dust motes drift through a single, soft beam of light that illuminates him.

14.(135.70-153.74)- A single, glowing drop of data falls from the top of the screen into a still, dark digital plane representing the company. Upon impact, a massive ripple of light ("THE SIGNAL") expands outwards. In the foreground, this ripple rushes towards the viewer. In the midground, the rigid, grid-like hierarchy of the company transforms into an organic, interconnected network as the ripple passes over it. A symbol of a cracked crown appears, then morphs into an interconnected node, representing a new leadership model. The words "THE CHANGE HAD BEGUN" fade in.
