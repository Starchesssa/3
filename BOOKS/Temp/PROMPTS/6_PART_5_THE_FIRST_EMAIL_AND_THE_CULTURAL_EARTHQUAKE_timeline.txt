1. (0.00 - 9.22) - A middle-aged 3D male silhouette in a sharp business suit, posing with quiet confidence while looking out a panoramic office window at a futuristic city, with the Microsoft logo glowing softly on the glass in parallax.
2. (9.22 - 16.20) - A 3D male silhouette in a simple engineer's sweater, posing pensively under a single intense spotlight on a vast, dark stage, with countless indistinct silhouettes watching from the parallax background.
3. (16.20 - 27.70) - A 3D male silhouette in business-casual attire, posing with intense focus as he leans over a desk to type, his face illuminated solely by the glow of a laptop screen in a dark office, parallax cityscape visible outside.
4. (27.70 - 36.22) - An abstract environment where a glowing blue shockwave, originating from an unseen source, shatters monolithic blocks representing old corporate ideas, all in a slow-motion parallax effect.
5. (36.22 - 46.74) - A professional 3D male silhouette posing with an open, welcoming gesture, standing before a growing, glowing neural network that forms the parallax background.
6. (46.74 - 62.86) - Multiple 3D male silhouettes in suits, posed in conflict around a dark boardroom table—one pointing aggressively, another with arms crossed—creating a tense, stagnant atmosphere with a parallax city view outside.
7. (62.86 - 77.56) - A group of casual 3D male silhouettes posed collaboratively in a bright, modern office; one shrugs inquisitively, another helps a colleague up, demonstrating a "learn-it-all" culture against a parallax office background.
8. (77.56 - 89.06) - A single 3D male silhouette in a suit, posed as if stumbling or caught off-balance under the harsh glare of multiple stage spotlights, creating a sense of vulnerability with a parallax audience in the dark.
9. (89.06 - 106.94) - A 3D male silhouette posed recoiling, head in hands, as he is bombarded by a storm of angry, glowing social media icons and negative headlines flying towards him in a chaotic parallax effect.
10. (106.94 - 120.00) - A 3D male silhouette with rolled-up sleeves, posed decisively at a desk, typing a message of apology on a screen while a storm visibly clears to sunshine in the parallax window view behind him.
11. (120.00 - 135.70) - A 3D male silhouette posed with a slight bow and a hand over his heart, a gesture of sincere apology, surrounded by the softly glowing words "OWN IT" and "LEARN" in an abstract parallax space.
12. (135.70 - 153.74) - A 3D male silhouette posing in a receptive, open stance on a mountaintop, looking towards a new dawn where the four-pane Microsoft logo rises like the sun, casting a long shadow forward in a deep parallax landscape.
