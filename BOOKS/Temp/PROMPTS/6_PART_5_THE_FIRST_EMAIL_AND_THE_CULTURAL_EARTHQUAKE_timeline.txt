1. (0.00-9.22) - A single geometric character stands on a glowing, elevated platform, head held high as a holographic, data-stream crown is placed above its angular head by an unseen force, all within a vast, dark server hall with parallax layers of binary code.
2. (9.22-16.20) - A central geometric character stands illuminated by a harsh spotlight, while a circle of shadowy, angular figures in the parallax foreground lean in with sharp, questioning poses, their forms creating an intimidating cage of doubt.
3. (16.20-27.70) - A lone geometric character sits in a minimalist, dark office overlooking a neon-drenched cyberpunk city, their hand poised over a single glowing key on a holographic interface, a pose of quiet, focused intent.
4. (27.70-36.22) - A geometric character stands firm at the epicenter of a tectonic shift, the floor shattering into data-shards around them; stylized holographic logos of competitors crack and fall into a deep, dark abyss in the parallax background.
5. (36.22-46.74) - A geometric character holds a softly glowing orb of light with a gentle, studious pose as crumbling, monolithic pillars of tradition collapse in the background, replaced by rising, fluid structures of light in the deep parallax.
6. (46.74-62.86) - Multiple sharp, geometric characters stand in a sterile, white room, their poses arrogant and confrontational, chests puffed out and arms crossed, refusing to look at one another while their reflections repeat infinitely in the parallax mirrored walls.
7. (62.86-77.56) - Two geometric characters collaborate over a collapsed structure of glowing blocks; one character has a supportive hand on the other's shoulder, their pose encouraging, as they both look up at a new holographic blueprint forming in the air.
8. (77.56-89.06) - A single geometric character is caught mid-stumble on a massive, brightly lit stage, arms flailing for balance in a sudden, vulnerable pose, with the shadowy silhouettes of a vast, geometric audience in the deep parallax background.
9. (89.06-106.94) - A geometric character kneels with its head bowed, a pose of being overwhelmed, as a brutal storm of sharp, red-glowing shards representing criticism flies in from the parallax background and shatters against them.
10. (106.94-120.00) - A geometric character stands in a powerful pose, pushing against and toppling a massive, cracked concrete monolith that represents old ideas, revealing a clean, brightly lit path in the parallax background.
11. (120.00-142.20) - A lone geometric character stands with its hands held open in a pose of utter transparency, a warm light emanating from its chest that pushes back the darkness, as other figures in the parallax background shift from aggressive to receptive stances.
12. (142.20-153.74) - A geometric character stands at the edge of a vast, dark data-pool, their pose calm and deliberate as they drop a single glowing pebble, sending massive, concentric rings of light rippling out across the entire parallax environment.
