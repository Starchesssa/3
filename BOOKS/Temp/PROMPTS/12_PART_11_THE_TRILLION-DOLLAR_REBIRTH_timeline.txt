1.  **(0.00 - 10.22)** - A stylized, dark Microsoft campus building is seen with a storm brewing overhead. The camera pushes in through a window with a parallax effect, where the raindrops on the glass move faster than the building itself. Inside, a chaotic montage begins:
    *   **(Firings):** **2D silhouettes** of employees are sucked out of office doors as if by a vacuum.
    *   **(Write-downs):** A giant, red, glowing "WRITE-DOWN" stamp smashes onto a stack of financial ledgers, which shatter into digital fragments.
    *   **(Partnerships):** Two large, opposing corporate logos slam into each other, cracking on impact.
    *   **(Gutting Culture):** The camera dives into the building's foundation, where the word "CULTURE," engraved in stone, is being violently chipped away by pneumatic drills held by other **silhouettes**.

2.  **(10.88 - 15.54)** - We see a single, calm **3D silhouette** of a leader standing in the center of the previously shown chaos. As the narrator says "staggering turnarounds," the silhouette raises a hand. The surrounding debris and shattered fragments freeze, then reverse their motion, flying back together. They don't reform the old building but construct a new, gleaming, futuristic glass skyscraper that rises rapidly into the sky. The parallax effect shows the clouds in the background moving slowly, accentuating the impossibly fast construction of the new tower. On-screen text animates: "A TURNAROUND FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS."

3.  **(16.18 - 23.22)** - A close-up on a retro, CRT-style stock market screen. The ticker for "MSFT" is shown, flickering weakly. A flat, lifeless stock chart is graphed out next to it. The camera slowly pans across the screen, the curved glass of the monitor providing a natural parallax distortion of the flickering numbers in the background. A digital calendar overlay appears, flipping its pages rapidly to land on **FEBRUARY 2014**. A price tag graphic is stamped next to the ticker: **$36**.

4.  **(23.64 - 34.64)** - A wide, split-screen shot. On the left third of the screen is a small, dusty, beige Microsoft building with its market cap displayed below: **$300 Billion**. On the right two-thirds, two colossal, gleaming skyscrapers representing Apple and Google loom over it, their much larger market cap numbers blinking like aviation lights. Using parallax, the camera tracks slowly to the right, making the Microsoft building appear to shrink and recede into the distance while the other two towers grow even more imposing in the foreground.

5.  **(35.32 - 44.72)** - A shot inside a dark server farm. A single server rack labeled "AZURE" begins to pulse with a bright blue light. Lines of light, representing data, shoot out from it, initially as a trickle, then multiplying exponentially into a flood that fills the screen. The camera glides sideways through the server racks, creating a parallax effect where the foreground racks and light streams move much faster than the rows in the deep background. The scene cross-fades to a grid of "Office 365" icons multiplying rapidly across a digital landscape, like a time-lapse of a fast-growing plant.

6.  **(45.12 - 53.16)** - The camera moves through a drab, grey office where **2D silhouettes** are separated by cubicle walls that look like thorny vines ("toxic culture"). As the camera progresses, the vines wither and dissolve, and the walls retract into the floor, creating a bright, open, collaborative space. New, "brilliant" **3D silhouettes**, glowing with an inner light, walk in and begin interacting. The scene cuts to the Wall Street "Charging Bull" statue. Its bronze head slowly turns to look up, its gaze fixed on the glowing Microsoft skyscraper in the far-off city skyline. The parallax effect makes the bull feel solid and present while the city behind it seems distant and aspirational.

7.  **(53.86 - 63.58)** - A 3D, Tron-like graph of the MSFT stock price materializes on screen. It starts as a slow, climbing line. As the narration says "then faster," the line ignites like a fuse, accelerating into a light cycle from Tron. The camera chases the light cycle as it smashes through glowing, crystal barriers marked **$50**, then **$70**, and finally launches off a ramp to fly through a giant neon hoop marked **$100**. The background is a grid of financial data that blurs with speed, creating a strong parallax effect.

8.  **(64.18 - 73.26)** - A series of stylized quarterly earnings reports slap down onto the screen, one after another, overlapping. The camera zooms into the "AZURE GROWTH" line item on each one. The number spins like a slot machine before locking into place: **+93%**, **+89%**, **+76%**. A persistent on-screen graphic glows brightly: "**CONSISTENTLY > 50% YEAR-OVER-YEAR**". The layers of reports create a sense of depth and consistency, with the parallax effect visible as the camera slightly shifts, showing the edges of the reports beneath.

9.  **(73.74 - 85.60)** - A cosmic horse race. Two celestial constellations, one in the shape of an apple and one a window, are racing across the galaxy. The apple is in the lead. As the narrator says "the impossible happened," the window constellation flares with blue energy, accelerates, and overtakes the apple just before a finish line made of stardust. The finish line banner materializes with the text: "**MOST VALUABLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD**". The parallax of distant galaxies moving slower than nearby star fields emphasizes the incredible speed of the race.

10. **(85.90 - 90.62)** - A fossilized dinosaur skeleton labeled "MICROSOFT" stands in a dark museum. The bones begin to glow with blue digital light. They rearrange and reassemble, not into a dinosaur, but into a sleek, powerful panther made of chrome and circuits. It lets out a roar that shatters the museum's glass dome. The camera looks up through the shattered dome as the chrome panther stands on the roof, surveying a modern city. The parallax of the falling glass shards contrasts with the static power of the reborn creature.

11. **(91.28 - 97.54)** - A close-up of a massive, industrial-looking digital counter. The numbers are rapidly ticking up towards one trillion. The camera is tight on the last few digits. As the narrator says "April 2019," the counter clicks over: **$999,999,999,999** becomes **$1,000,000,000,000**. As it hits the trillion mark, a powerful shockwave of light emanates from the numbers, and the camera pulls back to reveal the counter is on the face of a new, monumental Mount Rushmore, with the faces of tech pioneers. The parallax effect shows the mountain in the foreground against a slowly moving sky.

12. **(97.95 - 104.80)** - Quick-cut montage visualizing $700 billion.
    *   A stack of one-dollar bills rising past the clouds.
    *   A graphic showing the entire GDP of a small country with "$700 Billion" stamped over it.
    *   The final shot: a giant scale. On one side, the old, small Microsoft building from the earlier scene. On the other side, a **3D silhouette** of Nadella drops a glowing blue cube labeled "+$700 BILLION" onto the pan, which slams down, launching the old building into the air. The parallax shows the background financial charts remaining steady as the scale moves dramatically.

13. **(105.28 - 114.46)** - The stock chart is now a rocket ship, leaving Earth's atmosphere. It blasts past a moon labeled **$200**, then navigates a dense asteroid field where the asteroids are shaped like analyst doubts and negative headlines. It emerges into open space, soaring towards a distant, glowing blue nebula marked **$300**. The parallax effect is extreme, with foreground asteroids whizzing by while the distant nebula seems to draw closer at a slower, more majestic pace.

14. **(114.92 - 133.20)** - A final, symbolic scene. A **3D silhouette** of a leader stands before a giant, fog-covered wall ("Brutal Facts"). He pushes his hands against it, and it crumbles. He then approaches a tangled, thorny maze ("Ingrained Culture") and sets it ablaze with a touch, clearing a path. Finally, he stands at the edge of a cliff ("The Past") and, instead of clinging to it, he takes a confident leap of faith. He doesn't fall; a bridge of light ("The Future") materializes under his feet, leading toward a bright horizon. The parallax layers show the ghosts of the old challenges fading into the background as he walks forward into the light.
