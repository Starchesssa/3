1.(0.00-10.22)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head and no face, looking overwhelmed amidst a storm of flying papers and fragmented, chaotic geometric shapes representing a collapsing office culture.
2.(10.88-15.54)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head and no face, standing at the base of a massive, glowing upward-pointing arrow, their pose powerful and looking up with determination, signifying a dramatic turnaround.
3.(16.18-23.22)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head and no face, standing firmly at a geometric lectern, with a large background screen displaying a low, flat stock ticker line at "$36".
4.(23.64-34.64)- a geometric vector illustration style of a small character with an abstract angular head and no face, hunched over slightly as they are dwarfed by two colossal, towering geometric monoliths that cast long, oppressive shadows over them.
5.(35.32-44.72)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head and no face, dynamically interacting with a network of vibrant, glowing geometric vines that are exploding with growth all around them.
6.(45.12-53.16)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head and no face, shedding a dark, jagged cloak, adopting an open and welcoming pose as other figures are drawn towards them, all under the gaze of a large, abstract geometric eye in the background.
7.(53.86-63.58)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head and no face, in a dynamic pose, running up a steep, glowing graph line, shattering glowing numerical barriers of "$50" and "$100".
8.(64.18-73.26)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head and no face, looking up in awe from a tablet as a massive, glowing "50%" erupts from it like a firework, amidst swirling data streams.
9.(73.74-85.60)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head and no face, in a triumphant pose on the summit of a sharp, crystalline mountain, planting a flag and looking down on a slightly lower neighboring peak.
10.(85.90-90.62)- a geometric vector illustration style of a crumbling, fossilized dinosaur skeleton, with a sleek, powerful character with an abstract angular head rising phoenix-like from the dust in a powerful pose.
11.(91.28-97.54)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head and no face, taking a long, decisive stride over a brightly glowing line on the floor labeled "$1 Trillion" into an illuminated space.
12.(97.95-104.80)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head and no face, posed like a conductor, orchestrating hundreds of glowing geometric blocks that are flying in to form a massive, stable structure.
13.(105.28-114.46)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head and no face, stylized as a sleek rocket, blasting vertically through abstract atmospheric layers and shattering glowing price markers.
14.(114.92-131.34)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head and no face, standing decisively at a crossroads, pointing towards a solid, brightly lit path labeled "FUTURE" while the "PAST" path crumbles behind them.
15.(131.72-133.20)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head and no face, standing with arms crossed in a pose of satisfaction atop a vast, completed geometric megastructure, surveying their work.
