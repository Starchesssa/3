1. (0.00 - 5.62) - A stylized graph showing a company's value plummeting sharply before making a dramatic upward turn. A 2D male silhouette stands at the lowest point of the curve, looking up towards the rising line. A blurred, modern cityscape serves as the background. With the parallax effect, the silhouette in the foreground is most prominent, while the graph and the city background shift at different rates.

2. (6.10 - 11.58) - A close-up shot focusing on a book titled "Hit Refresh" resting on a desk. In the background, out of focus, a 3D male silhouette representing the CEO stands confidently looking out a large office window. The parallax effect shows the book in the foreground, the silhouette in the midground, and the city view outside the window in the deep background, all moving independently.

3. (11.94 - 17.24) - An imposing, slightly dated monolithic corporate building under a gray, overcast sky. In the foreground, a lone male silhouette looks up at the massive structure, which represents the "dinosaur" company. The parallax effect creates depth, with the silhouette feeling close to the viewer while the building looms in the midground and the clouds drift slowly behind it.

4. (17.84 - 27.00) - A split-screen visual. The left side shows a dark, chaotic boardroom with 2D male silhouettes arguing over a table. The right side is a bright, modern, and collaborative office space where silhouettes work together around a glowing digital interface. A stock ticker graph is seen rising sharply on the right side towards "$1T". The parallax effect makes elements near the central divide appear to move over the opposing scene as the view shifts.

5. (27.56 - 31.34) - An abstract representation of a company's culture. In the center, a large, glowing orb is changing from a dull, flickering red to a vibrant, steady blue. Around it, several 3D male silhouettes are interacting, connecting with lines of light, representing a shift in the company's soul. The parallax effect gives the orb a sense of floating between the foreground silhouettes and a background of abstract data patterns.

6. (31.86 - 41.92) - A dramatic, wide shot of a boardroom table. On one side, a passionate CEO silhouette gestures energetically. On the other side of the table, a huge stack of financial documents and blueprints bursts into stylized, digital flames, representing a costly failed bet. Using the parallax effect, the smoke and embers in the foreground drift across the scene, independent of the midground figures and the dark office background.

7. (42.60 - 49.38) - A symbolic scene of renewal. In the foreground, charred pages of a blueprint labeled "OLD STRATEGY" crumble into ash. From the rising ashes in the midground, the glowing, digital framework of a new, futuristic structure materializes, representing the "new empire." A single male silhouette watches the transformation. The parallax effect makes the ashes swirl realistically in front of the forming structure and dark background.

8. (49.96 - 53.22) - A cinematic shot styled like a thriller movie poster. We see a 2D male silhouette from behind, standing at the entrance of a long, dark, and imposing corporate hallway. At the far end, a brightly lit doorway promises a new future. The parallax effect enhances the sense of depth, with the near walls of the hallway blurring past faster than the distant, illuminated door.

9. (53.74 - 68.54) - A clean shot of a modern desk. A smartphone playing an audiobook, a physical copy of "Hit Refresh," and a tablet with the e-book are arranged neatly. A 3D silhouette's hand enters the frame, reaching towards the audiobook. The parallax effect creates a sense of depth between the hand in the foreground, the items on the midground desk, and the softly blurred office environment behind them, followed by a final fast zoom-in effect as if entering the story.
