1.  (0.00 - 9.28) - A lone 3D male silhouette stands before a giant, glowing book titled 'Hit Refresh'. A thick blue fog swirls around the floor of an empty, vast space.

2.  (9.28 - 17.24) - A male silhouette looks up at a giant, decaying, old computer monitor that looks like a fossil. The room is dark, filled with a sickly green fog.

3.  (17.24 - 27.00) - A male silhouette holds a glowing blueprint, standing between a crumbling brick building and a sleek, modern glass skyscraper. A green fog envelops the old building while a blue light emanates from the new one.

4.  (27.00 - 31.34) - A close-up of a 3D silhouette's hands touching a large, mechanical heart made of old gears and wires. Where the hands touch, the heart transforms into glowing blue circuits.

5.  (31.34 - 41.92) - Two groups of male silhouettes face off across a boardroom table. A stack of papers on the table is engulfed in flames, casting a menacing red light and fog throughout the room.

6.  (41.92 - 49.38) - A single male silhouette stands atop a massive pile of shattered smartphones. Behind him, a giant, glowing cloud symbol rises from the ashen, grey fog.

7.  (49.38 - 68.54) - A 3D male silhouette is seen from behind, walking down a dark hallway. The hallway ends in a brightly lit doorway shaped like the four-colored Microsoft logo.
