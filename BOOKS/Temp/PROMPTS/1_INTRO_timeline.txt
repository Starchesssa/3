1.(0.00-9.28)- a geometric vector illustration style of a lone 3D silhouette with an abstract angular head, wearing a modern business suit, standing in a dynamic pose. He holds open a glowing book that radiates light, illuminating a large, futuristic stock chart in the background showing a massive upward spike. The words "CORPORATE COMEBACK" are etched into the parallax background architecture.

2.(9.72-17.24)- a geometric vector illustration style of a determined 3D silhouette with an abstract angular head, wearing a CEO's suit, standing with his hands in his pockets. He gazes up defiantly at a colossal, fossilized dinosaur skeleton made of crumbling computer parts. A faded, cracked Microsoft logo is visible on the dinosaur's skull, symbolizing an ancient, dying giant. The environment is a desolate, gray corporate wasteland.

3.(17.24-27.56)- a geometric vector illustration style of a powerful 3D silhouette with an abstract angular head, posed like a conductor. With arms outstretched, he transforms a dark, chaotic, thorny machine on the left into a sleek, glowing, crystalline monster on the right. VFX of glowing dollar signs and data streams flow from his hands toward the new creation. The words "TRILLION DOLLAR" are emblazoned in the sky behind.

4.(27.56-31.86)- a geometric vector illustration style of a central 3D silhouette with an abstract angular head, presenting a radiant, pulsating orb of light—the company's "soul." A group of other business silhouettes in a circle reach out to touch the orb, their own angular bodies beginning to glow in response. The background is a network of complex gears, shifting from chaos into a harmonious, synchronized pattern.

5.(31.86-42.60)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D CEO silhouette with an abstract angular head, standing calm and intense while engulfed in stylized digital flames. Around him, two factions of business silhouettes are in conflict, pushing against each other in a cracked boardroom. In the background, a massive pile of geometric blocks representing billions of dollars goes up in flames, disintegrating into ash.

6.(42.60-49.38)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette with an abstract angular head, standing in a powerful pose amidst a landscape of digital ashes. He looks down at a shattered tablet labeled "FAILED STRATEGY" at his feet. Behind him, a magnificent and glowing new empire of sleek, geometric towers rises like a phoenix from the ashes into a clean sky.

7.(49.96-53.74)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette with an abstract angular head, wearing a sharp suit and a flowing trench coat. He is captured in a dynamic running pose, glancing over his shoulder down a dark, neon-lit, high-tech corridor. The low-angle perspective and long, sharp shadows create the tense, exciting atmosphere of a corporate thriller movie poster.

8.(53.74-67.62)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette with an abstract angular head, relaxing in a minimalist, modern armchair while wearing large headphones. Glowing soundwaves emanate from their head. In front of them, a holographic display shows the "Hit Refresh" book cover, the Audible logo, and a prominent button that says "FREE TRIAL" in a parallax effect.

9.(67.62-68.54)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette with an abstract angular head, wearing a sleek outfit, captured mid-air in a dramatic dive. The figure plunges headfirst into a swirling, futuristic vortex of light and binary code, creating a powerful sense of motion and embarking on the story.
