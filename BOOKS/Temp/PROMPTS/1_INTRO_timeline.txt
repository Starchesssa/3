1.  (0.00-9.79) - A 3D male silhouette in a smart shirt stands on a digital peak, holding a glowing book aloft, overlooking a vast, parallaxing landscape of data streams under a sky with Microsoft-colored aurora borealis.

2.  (9.79-17.24) - A determined 3D male silhouette in a suit stands before the colossal, crumbling fossil of a dinosaur made of old computer parts. The environment is a dusty, derelict server room with flickering, dying lights creating a parallax effect.

3.  (17.24-27.00) - A powerful 3D male silhouette with rolled-up sleeves swings a glowing hammer, shattering a crumbling, toxic-green monolith. From the parallaxing shards, a new, vibrant blue crystalline skyscraper grows into the sky.

4.  (27.00-35.82) - Two identical 3D male silhouettes in a tense back-to-back pose, pushing each other apart. The environment is a fractured digital space with rigid, red error codes on one side and fluid, blue data streams on the other, creating a conflicted parallax background.

5.  (35.82-41.92) - A lone 3D CEO silhouette, glowing with an inner fire, stands defiantly as a massive structure made of smartphones burns and collapses into digital flames behind him in a dramatic parallax effect.

6.  (41.92-49.38) - From a landscape of grey, parallaxing ashes and burnt hardware, a 3D male silhouette rises, looking up as a magnificent, glowing phoenix made of blue cloud data spreads its wings and soars.

7.  (49.38-57.36) - A 3D male silhouette in a trench coat stands on a skyscraper ledge, looking down at a neon-drenched, rainy city grid. He holds a glowing pair of headphones, with parallaxing data streams reflected in the wet streets below.

8.  (57.36-68.54) - A 3D male silhouette stands before a glowing digital portal, his hand outstretched in an inviting gesture. Floating around him in a parallax effect are a glowing physical book, a smartphone playing an audiobook, and a tablet.
