**73.14 - 77.56:** A modern, sunlit office space. On a glass whiteboard, a complex diagram is crossed out with a red marker. Next to it, an arrow points to a new, simpler diagram with the word "LEARNINGS" written above it.

**78.02 - 83.88:** A stylized, dramatic shot of silhouetted figures in business attire standing on a physical, stacked bell curve. The figure at the top looks triumphant, while figures on lower tiers appear dejected or are subtly pushing each other. The lighting is harsh, creating long, dark shadows.

**84.54 - 89.06:** Medium shot of Satya Nadella on a large conference stage under bright spotlights. He has a slightly panicked or uncertain expression as he stands at a podium, caught in a moment of hesitation.

**89.48 - 94.90:** A split-screen view. On the left, a professional woman in an audience asks a question into a microphone. On the right, a close-up of Satya Nadella on stage, listening intently before he answers.

**95.60 - 98.00:** A close-up on the faces of several women in the conference audience, their expressions shifting from hopeful to shocked and disappointed.

**98.56 - 103.56:** A symbolic, infographic-style animation of a corporate ladder. A woman is at the bottom, looking up. At the top, instead of a promotion or a dollar sign, there is a glowing, ethereal symbol for "karma."

**104.04 - 106.94:** A rapid montage: phone screens endlessly scrolling through a storm of angry tweets, blog posts with critical headlines, and news channel chyrons displaying quotes from his gaffe. The effect is overwhelming and immediate.

**107.54 - 111.50:** A stark, imposing, and slightly dated corporate building with an old Microsoft logo. A hand from an unseen person inside posts a stiff, defensive-sounding press release on a window. The overall mood is cold and closed off.

**111.50 - 114.34:** A close-up shot of a hand decisively crumpling up the defensive press release from the previous scene.

**114.80 - 120.94:** An over-the-shoulder shot of Satya Nadella in a quiet office late at night, illuminated only by his laptop screen. He is typing an email. The camera focuses on the screen, where the words "I was completely wrong" are being typed.
