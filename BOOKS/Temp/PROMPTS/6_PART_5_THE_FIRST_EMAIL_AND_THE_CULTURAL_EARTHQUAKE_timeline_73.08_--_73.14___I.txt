1. (73.08 - 77.56) - A 2D parallax image of a male silhouette stumbling, but as they fall, a glowing lightbulb appears above their head, symbolizing learning from a mistake.

2. (77.56 - 83.88) - A 3D parallax scene showing a male silhouette swinging a large hammer, shattering a pyramid built from other silhouettes who are pushing each other down, representing the destruction of the "stack ranking" culture.

3. (83.88 - 89.06) - A male silhouette standing on a stage under a single, harsh spotlight. The stage floor beneath his feet is visibly cracking, showing the immense pressure and risk of failure.

4. (89.06 - 94.90) - A parallax image of a male silhouette on stage, with a large, glowing question mark being projected onto him from an unseen source, representing a difficult, public question.

5. (94.90 - 98.00) - A close-up on a male silhouette's head. As he speaks, a chaotic jumble of broken geometric shapes and static bursts from his mouth instead of words, symbolizing a disastrous answer.

6. (98.00 - 103.56) - A male silhouette gesturing towards a large, complex machine of gears. A glowing "karma" symbol (like a yin-yang) floats above the machine, representing a naive trust in an abstract system.

7. (103.56 - 106.94) - A 3D parallax scene of a single male silhouette being bombarded from all sides by a storm of sharp, aggressive arrows, representing immediate and brutal backlash.

8. (106.94 - 111.50) - A male silhouette defensively building a tall brick wall in front of himself, blocking out the arrows from the previous scene, symbolizing a defensive corporate statement.

9. (111.50 - 114.34) - A parallax image of a silhouette standing at a fork in the road. One path leads to the brick wall from the previous scene, but the silhouette is turning 180 degrees to take the opposite, open path.

10. (114.34 - 120.94) - A male silhouette sitting at a desk, typing. A large email icon emanates from the screen with the clear words "I WAS WRONG" inside it, radiating outward to represent a public admission of fault.
