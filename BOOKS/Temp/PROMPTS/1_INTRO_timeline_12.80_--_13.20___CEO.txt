1. (0.00 - 17.24) - A wide, cinematic 2D parallax shot of a lone male silhouette standing and looking up at a colossal, crumbling building shaped like a dinosaur skeleton. The old, faded Microsoft logo is cracked on the side of the structure, symbolizing a "dinosaur waiting to die." The atmosphere is dusty and desolate.

2. (17.24 - 24.62) - The camera zooms into a dark, oppressive office interior. Male silhouettes are isolated in cubicles, arguing and pointing fingers at each other. Jagged lines of red light, representing toxicity and conflict, connect them. The scene has a claustrophobic feel, illustrating the "toxic, dying giant."

3. (24.62 - 27.00) - A dramatic transition scene. The crumbling dinosaur building transforms into a sleek, futuristic skyscraper that towers into a bright, clear sky. The modern Microsoft logo glows at the pinnacle. The 3D parallax effect shows clouds drifting behind the tower, emphasizing its new, monolithic status as a "trillion dollar monster."

4. (27.00 - 31.34) - A close-up on a group of male silhouettes. One central silhouette places a glowing orb representing "soul" into the chest of another. Lines of light then spread from that orb, connecting the entire group in a collaborative network. In the background, old, physical product boxes are faded and discarded, showing the shift from "products" to "soul."

5. (31.34 - 36.40) - A stylized depiction of a large company logo being pulled in opposite directions by two teams of male silhouettes in a tug-of-war. The logo is fracturing down the middle. The background is a cracked, dark void, visually representing a "company at war with itself." The parallax layers create a sense of depth and tension in the conflict.
