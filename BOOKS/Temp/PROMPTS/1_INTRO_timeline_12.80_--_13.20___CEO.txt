A massive, slow-moving Brontosaurus, its skin cracked and gray like old concrete, has the old, four-color Microsoft Windows logo branded on its side. It stands in a dusty, barren landscape under a hazy, setting sun, looking outdated and out of place.

**16.38 - 17.24: waiting to die.**

A dramatic visual of a single, massive office building split down the middle. On one side, it's dark, with windows boarded up and employees in cubicles building walls between each other. On the other side, the office is bright, open, and collaborative. The two halves are actively pushing against each other, causing the ground to crack and sparks to fly at the point of conflict.
