1.  A massive, complex geometric structure made of interconnected cubes in shades of dark blue and purple. A single, small cube glows with a brilliant yellow light, sending out vibrant energy lines that connect to and illuminate the entire structure. Kurzgesagt style, clean lines, futuristic infographic.

2.  A side-by-side infographic. On the left, a small, organized cluster of glowing spheres is neatly enclosed by the outlines of two abstract, geometric pizza slices. A bright, swift energy arrow points away from it. On the right, a large, chaotic mass of spheres overflows the same pizza slice boundary, with a dim, slow-moving, fragmented arrow next to it. Vibrant colors.

3.  A small, cohesive group of glowing geometric shapes (triangles and circles) gathered around a single, complex, glowing crystal representing a project. Lines of light connect each shape to the crystal, showing them actively building and shaping it. Minimalist background, abstract infographic.

4.  A stark, minimalist visual. A bright, glowing arrow points right. It abruptly hits a central dividing line and pivots 180 degrees, now pointing left and changing color from a vibrant green to a cautionary red. Simple, abstract, high-contrast infographic.

5.  An abstract, glowing pie chart representing a global sphere. A huge, dominant slice, taking up almost half the chart, glows in a solid, confident blue, while the remaining smaller slices are in muted, varied colors. The year "2007" is subtly integrated. Futuristic infographic style.

6.  The same abstract pie chart from the previous image, but now the once-dominant blue slice has shrunk to a tiny, thin sliver. The other colored slices have grown to fill the entire space. A dramatic, jagged red arrow points down at the tiny blue sliver. The year "2013" is visible.

7.  A complex diagram showing a large, glowing central core. Numerous convoluted, winding, and obstructed pathways lead to it from the periphery. A small pulse of light is shown moving very slowly and inefficiently along one of these paths towards the center. Abstract, infographic style with a sense of blockage.

8.  A glowing spark of light, representing an idea, is trapped, trying to ascend through multiple, dense, stacked horizontal layers. In the background, a vibrant, fast-moving river of colorful particles flows past, representing the market, leaving the layered structure far behind.

9.  A single, small, self-contained pod, glowing with bright energy, is shown breaking away from a much larger, more complex mothership structure. The pod has the abstract "two-pizza slice" emblem on it. Kurzgesagt style, clean, high-contrast visual.

10. The small, glowing pod from the previous image is focused on a specific object: a complex, tangled knot of dark, chaotic lines. The pod projects a coherent beam of bright, organizing light onto the knot, which is beginning to untangle and re-form into a clean, geometric shape.

11. A futuristic bar graph. One bar, labeled "AWS 2023," towers over all others, glowing with an intense, golden light. It emits particles of light upwards, symbolizing massive revenue. The other bars are small and muted in color for contrast. Minimalist, data-visualization style.

12. A split-panel infographic. On the left, a large circle labeled "Total Sales" has a small, 16% slice glowing in bright cyan. On the right, an identical circle labeled "Total Profit" has a massive, dominant 60%+ slice glowing in the same bright cyan, visually demonstrating its disproportionate impact.

13. A small, glowing pod, representing the original team, sits at the base of a colossal, radiant tree of light whose branches are laden with glowing geometric fruits. In the distant background, the much larger but less bright "mothership" structure is visible, clearly outshone by the creation of the single team.
