1.(0.00 - 10.44) - a geometric vector illustration style of a powerful 3D silhouette with an angular head, wearing a sharp business suit, posing as a corporate warlord. He stands triumphantly atop a throne made of shattered computer monitors, looking down with a dominant posture. In the dark, parallax background, the word "CRUSHED" is etched into a metallic wall.

2.(10.44 - 26.52) - a geometric vector illustration style of a cunning 3D silhouette with a blank angular face, dressed in a sleek suit. The character has its arms open in a deceptive 'embrace' gesture, while large, shadowy, geometric tentacles emerge from its back, constricting smaller figures. In the background, the words "EMBRACE EXTINGUISH" glow menacingly.

3.(26.52 - 37.42) - a geometric vector illustration style of an isolated 3D silhouette in a suit, with a featureless angular head, standing defiantly inside a cage made of glowing red gavels. The background is dark and oppressive, with the word "HATED" scrawled in a stark, angular font.

4.(37.42 - 54.38) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette in modern, smart-casual attire with a blank angular face, taking a dynamic step forward. The figure is walking out of a dark, walled fortress and onto a bright, open bridge made of light, extending a hand in a gesture of peace towards a distant, abstract cloud-filled world.

5.(54.38 - 77.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of two imposing 3D silhouettes in business suits, their angular heads facing each other. They are collaboratively burying a geometric stone hatchet into the ground, from which a single glowing line of light sprouts upwards. In the background, the logos for Microsoft and Salesforce are dissolving and merging.

6.(77.72 - 99.90) - a geometric vector illustration style of two 3D silhouettes in suits, with blank angular faces, shaking hands on a stage. Behind them, a massive screen displays multiple company logos (Adobe, Salesforce) all connecting to a central Microsoft logo with pulsating lines of light, under the glowing words "WIN-WIN".

7.(99.90 - 111.04) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette with an angular head, wearing a modern suit, shaking hands with another silhouette wearing a stylized red fedora. In the background parallax, the word "CANCER" is shattered like broken glass, revealing a glowing Linux logo behind the cracks.

8.(111.04 - 123.84) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette with a featureless angular face, using a simple hammer to shatter an ornate, geometric crown labeled "EGO". The character is in a dynamic pose, turning away from the shattering crown to face a glowing orb with the word "CUSTOMERS" inside it.

9.(123.84 - 148.36) - a geometric vector illustration style of a menacing, spiky 3D silhouette labeled "BULLY" cracking and shedding its outer layer. It reveals a smoother, welcoming inner silhouette with open arms, labeled "PARTNER". In the background, multiple figures are sharing slices of a massive, ever-expanding glowing pie.
