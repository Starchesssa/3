1.(0.00-6.06)- A dramatic, wide shot of a towering, intimidating corporate skyscraper representing the old Microsoft. In front of it, two 2D male silhouettes, representing Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, stand like generals on a giant chessboard, casting long, dark shadows.

2.(6.06-10.44)- A central, large 3D male silhouette in a powerful stance, with its shadow falling over several smaller, cowering silhouettes scattered around it. The large silhouette's hand is posed as if about to crush one of the smaller figures, which represent other tech companies.

3.(10.44-15.68)- A triptych showing three distinct phases. 1) 'Embrace': A large silhouette warmly shaking hands with a smaller one. 2) 'Extend': The large silhouette adds a complex, glowing gear onto the smaller silhouette's back. 3) 'Extinguish': The smaller silhouette's light fades to black while the large one glows brighter.

4.(15.68-26.52)- An animated infographic sequence. A silhouette representing Microsoft connects its product (a puzzle piece) to a market leader's piece. It then adds proprietary attachments. Finally, a giant, translucent window pane slams down, shattering all competing puzzle pieces.

5.(26.52-34.34)- A 3D silhouette of a corporate building being bombarded by stacks of paper with gavel symbols on them, representing lawsuits. The papers pile up around the base of the building against a dark, stormy sky. Parallax effect shows the papers in the foreground moving faster than the building.

6.(34.34-41.10)- A split-screen. The left side is dark and grimy, showing the word "PARTNERSHIP" covered in mud. The right side is bright and clean, where a new male silhouette (Nadella) is wiping the same word clean, revealing a polished surface. The transition from one to the other is a smooth wipe.

7.(41.10-44.94)- A lone 3D male silhouette stands on a small, isolated digital platform floating in a vast sky filled with stylized data clouds. The silhouette looks out at other distant, disconnected platforms, conveying a sense of isolation in a connected world.

8.(44.94-51.74)- A 2D silhouette of a customer is shown struggling to juggle multiple, differently shaped blocks, each with a unique abstract tech logo. The blocks clearly don't fit together, showing incompatibility and user frustration.

9.(51.74-57.96)- A 3D male silhouette (Nadella) holding an olive branch walks across a newly formed bridge connecting two imposing, fortress-like towers. One tower is marked with a Microsoft-style logo, the other with a Salesforce-style cloud logo.

10.(57.96-65.44)- Two male silhouettes stand back-to-back on a stage, arms crossed in defiance. A jagged, glowing line separates them. One silhouette is stoic, the other has a more dynamic and "flashy" outline.

11.(65.44-74.72)- A silhouette on a podium (Benioff) is shown pointing and laughing at a large, monolithic corporate building silhouette in the audience. Abstract mocking icons (like a clown face) appear in a speech bubble above the podium.

12.(74.72-84.36)- Two 3D silhouettes (Nadella and Benioff) shake hands firmly in the center of the frame. In the background with a parallax effect, large, stylized gears representing Salesforce, Office 365, and Windows smoothly interlock and begin to turn together.

13.(84.36-92.54)- A cheerful animation showing two building silhouettes with green, upward-trending stock arrows next to them. In the foreground, a group of customer silhouettes give a synchronized thumbs-up, with happy emojis appearing above their heads.

14.(92.54-99.90)- A montage sequence with a parallax effect. A central silhouette (Nadella) is seen on stage shaking hands with different silhouettes. As each handshake occurs, a new company's abstract logo appears and connects via a beam of light to a central Microsoft cloud icon.

15.(99.90-111.04)- A dramatic scene. A silhouette (Nadella) shakes hands with another silhouette wearing a stylized red hat. In the background, a ghostly, faded silhouette of Steve Ballmer is visible, looking away with a speech bubble containing a biohazard symbol next to a stylized Linux penguin.

16.(111.04-115.72)- A simple, elegant animation of a balancing scale. On one side, a heavy, ornate crown labeled "EGO" is being outweighed and lifted by a simple, glowing brain icon labeled "PRAGMATISM" on the other side.

17.(115.72-123.84)- A 3D scene where a central silhouette (Nadella) acts as a bridge, connecting the hands of two other competing silhouettes. A glowing, protective sphere surrounds a group of customer silhouettes in the background, emphasizing them as the priority.

18.(123.84-133.94)- An animation of a stone mask with an angry, bullying expression cracking and falling away from the facade of a corporate building. Underneath, the building is revealed to have open, welcoming doors and glowing windows.

19.(133.94-140.06)- A time-lapse animation shows a small sapling growing into a large, mature tree. The roots of the tree are visibly and gently wrapped around a group of customer silhouettes at its base, symbolizing protection and a strong foundation.

20.(140.06-148.36)- A split-screen comparison. On one side, two silhouettes violently fight over a small, crumbling piece of pie. On the other side, a massive, growing pie is being shared peacefully by numerous silhouettes, each with a satisfying slice. The parallax effect makes the large pie seem to expand towards the viewer.
