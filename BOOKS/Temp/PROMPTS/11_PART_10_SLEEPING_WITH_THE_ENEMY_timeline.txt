1. (0.00 - 10.44) - a geometric vector illustration style of a powerful character with an abstract angular black head, dressed in a sharp suit, standing triumphantly on a pile of shattered geometric shapes representing defeated rivals. The character's pose is a dominant warlord stance, set within a dark, imposing throne room with sharp pillars in parallax.

2. (10.44 - 15.68) - a geometric vector illustration style of a large, imposing character with an abstract angular black head constricting a smaller character in a deceptive embrace. The smaller figure is starting to fracture and dissolve, representing the 'extinguish' phase, set against a stark, abstract background with three glowing pathways in parallax.

3. (15.68 - 26.52) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular black head using a massive, glowing geometric object shaped like a window to crush smaller, competing structures. The character's pose shows immense force and intent, set against a dark, digital cityscape in parallax.

4. (26.52 - 37.42) - a geometric vector illustration style of a defiant character with an abstract angular black head, bound by glowing geometric chains representing lawsuits. The character is standing alone and surrounded by a whirlwind of sharp, paper-like shapes in a vast, dark hall in parallax.

5. (37.42 - 44.94) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular black head standing at a precipice, looking up at a vast, interconnected network of glowing, geometric clouds. The character's pose is open and visionary, with one arm outstretched towards the future, against a bright, optimistic sky in parallax.

6. (44.94 - 54.38) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular black head acting as a diplomat, connecting two separate, floating geometric platforms with a bridge of light. The character's pose is one of building and offering, set in a collaborative, bright environment in parallax.

7. (54.38 - 65.44) - a geometric vector illustration style of two rival characters with abstract angular black heads cautiously shaking hands in the middle of a fractured landscape. Their sharp, geometric armor is retracting, and a single glowing plant grows where their hands meet, with two opposing fortresses in the background in parallax.

8. (65.44 - 74.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of two characters with abstract angular black heads on a competitive stage. One character stands on a higher podium, gesturing mockingly towards the other below, who stands defiantly. The air between them crackles with sharp, aggressive energy lines, set in a geometric arena in parallax.

9. (74.72 - 86.10) - a geometric vector illustration style of two characters with abstract angular black heads standing side-by-side, jointly holding up a single, glowing geometric object that represents their partnership. Their poses are synchronized and supportive, with data streams merging behind them in a bright, futuristic environment in parallax.

10. (86.10 - 99.90) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular black head on a stage, shaking hands with another distinct character. In the background, semi-transparent ghost images of previous handshakes are visible, creating a sense of repeated success against a large presentation screen in parallax.

11. (99.90 - 111.04) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular black head gently touching a large, menacingly spiky red geometric structure. Where the hand touches, the structure’s spikes soften and it begins to glow, integrating into a network of light, set within a dark data space in parallax.

12. (111.04 - 123.84) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular black head decisively pushing away a large, crumbling geometric throne representing ego. The character is turning to offer a helping hand to a group of smaller figures representing customers, guiding them along a path of light in a minimalist environment in parallax.

13. (123.84 - 140.06) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular black head stepping out of a fractured, dark, and menacing geometric armor. The emerging figure is composed of brighter lines and extends an open hand, moving from a dark background into a bright one in parallax.

14. (140.06 - 148.36) - a geometric vector illustration style of several characters with abstract angular black heads working together to assemble a massive, glowing, pie chart-like structure. In the distant background, a smaller, broken pie lies abandoned in shadow, set in a vast, expansive environment in parallax.
