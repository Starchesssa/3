1. (0.00 - 10.44) - A giant, imposing 3D male silhouette stands like a warlord on a hill, casting a long shadow. Below, in a valley filled with dark blue fog, smaller silhouettes representing other companies are scattered and broken. A parallax effect shows the fog swirling in the foreground.

2. (10.96 - 15.68) - In a dark room with blue neon lighting, a 3D silhouette of a snake with the Microsoft logo on its head coils around a smaller, glowing orb. The words "EMBRACE, EXTEND, EXTINGUISH" are faintly stenciled on the back wall, creating a sense of depth with parallax.

3. (16.02 - 26.52) - A massive, glowing 3D Windows logo swings like a wrecking ball towards a small, fragile building. A male silhouette is visible in a control booth in the background. Blue light from the logo illuminates the scene with a parallax effect on the swinging chain.

4. (26.96 - 37.42) - A lone 3D male silhouette in a suit stands in a vast, empty courtroom filled with a somber grey-blue fog. A giant, shadowy gavel hangs ominously above him, slightly out of focus in the foreground to create a parallax effect.

5. (38.30 - 44.94) - A 3D male silhouette stands at a crossroads. One path is a single, dark road leading to a wall. The other path splits into many bright, interconnected lines leading towards a glowing cloud in a bright blue sky. Parallax effect on the clouds.

6. (45.46 - 57.96) - Two 3D male silhouettes shake hands on a newly built bridge over a chasm. One side of the chasm glows with Microsoft's blue light, the other with Salesforce's slightly different blue. The two colors mix into a swirling fog over the bridge.

7. (58.70 - 77.72) - Close up on a 3D silhouette's hands dropping a rusty hatchet into a freshly dug hole in the ground. In the background, a blue fog begins to clear, revealing a brighter sky, creating a parallax depth effect.

8. (78.08 - 92.54) - A 3D male silhouette stands on a stage, shaking hands with the CEO of Adobe. The Microsoft silhouette is illuminated by a blue spotlight, the Adobe silhouette by a red one. The lights mix to create a purple glow around their clasped hands.

9. (93.00 - 104.48) - A central, glowing Microsoft logo sends out beams of light connecting to other logos in the distance: SAP (blue), Oracle (red), and a particularly bright one to Red Hat (fiery red). Red fog drifts across the foreground with parallax.

10. (104.76 - 115.72) - A 3D male silhouette ignores a large, ornate crown (Ego) and instead picks up a simple, glowing gear (Pragmatism) from a platform. The scene is lit with clean, pragmatic blue light.

11. (116.36 - 129.36) - A large, aggressive silhouette of a bully slowly morphs its shape. Its shadow on the wall behind it transforms from a monster into a simple human shape with an outstretched hand. The lighting shifts from harsh dark blue to a softer, modern blue.

12. (129.78 - 148.36) - On the left, two silhouettes fight over a small, crumbling pie in a dark, grey-lit room. On the right, in a bright, warmly lit space, several silhouettes share pieces of a massive, glowing pie that is slowly expanding. The parallax effect makes the glowing pie feel closer.
