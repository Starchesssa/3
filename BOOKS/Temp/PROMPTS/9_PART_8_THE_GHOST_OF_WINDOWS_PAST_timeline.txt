1.(0.00-12.74)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D character with an angular black head kneeling in reverence before a giant, glowing window icon in a vast, minimalist temple, parallax background.
2.(12.74-20.68)- a geometric vector illustration style of several 3D characters with angular black heads orbiting a massive, glowing window icon that acts as a sun in a dark, abstract space, parallax effect.
3.(20.68-29.96)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D character with an angular black head wearing window-icon blinders, walking forward and narrowly missing abstract shapes of the internet and mobile flying past, parallax background.
4.(29.96-46.90)- a geometric vector illustration style of multiple 3D characters with angular black heads dynamically interacting with a variety of floating, abstract device shapes in a vibrant, geometric cityscape, parallax background.
5.(46.90-64.40)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D character with an angular black head standing with arms outstretched, sending glowing lines of energy to a variety of abstract device shapes surrounding a geometric globe, parallax background.
6.(64.40-87.00)- a geometric vector illustration style of an aggressive 3D character with an angular black head pointing accusatorially at a second character from which dark, creeping geometric tendrils emerge, parallax background.
7.(87.00-96.78)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D character with an angular black head warmly embracing another character with a glowing geometric penguin icon on its chest, symbolizing acceptance, parallax background.
8.(96.78-116.52)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D character with an angular black head acting as a bridge between two glowing screens, one with a window icon and one with a penguin icon, merging data streams, parallax effect.
9.(116.52-131.78)- a geometric vector illustration style of a defiant 3D character with an angular black head forcefully breaking a stone tablet engraved with a window icon, as a crowd in the background reacts in shock, parallax background.
10.(131.78-155.18)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D character with an angular black head standing on the fragments of a broken window icon as a vibrant, geometric ecosystem grows up from the barren ground, parallax background.
