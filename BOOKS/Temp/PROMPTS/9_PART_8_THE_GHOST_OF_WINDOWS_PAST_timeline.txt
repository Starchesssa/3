1.(0.00-5.82)- A grand hall styled like a cathedral. At the far end, instead of an altar, there is a giant, glowing, stained-glass window in the shape of the classic 4-pane Windows logo. Silhouettes of people are all facing it in a posture of reverence.
2.(5.82-12.74)- A 2D male silhouette stands at a crossroads where multiple paths diverge. The paths are labeled "Products," "Strategy," and "Decisions." Despite the different starting points, all paths are shown converging towards a single point on the horizon: a glowing Windows logo. A parallax effect shows the paths moving faster than the distant logo.
3.(12.74-20.68)- A stylized animation of a solar system. At the center is a brightly glowing sun shaped like the Windows logo. Several smaller, dimmer planets with icons for "Office," "Xbox," and "Server" are shown orbiting it in a fixed, predictable pattern.
4.(20.68-26.26)- A 3D male silhouette is staring intently at the Windows "sun" from the previous scene. Their back is turned as three massive comets streak across the screen behind them, labeled "Internet," "Search," and "Mobile." The silhouette does not turn, completely missing them.
5.(26.26-29.96)- A silhouette of a leader stands resolutely. Behind him, the giant stained-glass Windows logo from the first scene is shown with large cracks appearing across it, with pieces beginning to crumble and fall away.
6.(29.96-35.00)- A split-screen animation. On the left, an old, boxy desktop PC with the Windows logo is shown. On the right, a dynamic collage of modern devices—a sleek laptop, a smartphone, a tablet—are shown being used by various silhouettes.
7.(35.00-40.22)- A close-up shot panning across a variety of devices lined up on a surface: an iPhone, an Android tablet, a Macbook, and a Chromebook. Silhouettes of hands are shown interacting with each one, highlighting the diversity of platforms.
8.(40.22-46.90)- A stark visual metaphor. A 2D male silhouette in a business suit struggles to hitch a modern, sleek briefcase to an old-fashioned horse-drawn cart. In the background, with a parallax effect, modern cars speed past on a highway, representing the new technology being ignored.
9.(46.90-54.12)- A silhouette of a leader figure stands before a giant whiteboard. He dramatically erases a diagram that shows everything pointing inward to a central "Windows" logo. The words "WINDOWS FIRST" are crossed out with a bold red 'X'.
10.(54.12-60.98)- The whiteboard from the previous scene is now filled with a new diagram. In the center are Microsoft service icons (Azure, Office 365). Arrows point outwards from the center to a wide array of device icons (laptops, phones, tablets from different brands) encircling the services.
11.(60.98-69.02)- A silhouette of a Microsoft employee is shown standing at a fork in the road. One path, labeled with a Windows icon, leads to a brick wall. The other path, labeled with an open-source gear icon, leads towards a bright, open horizon where a small penguin (the Linux mascot) can be seen.
12.(69.02-78.02)- An animation of a data center. On the left, server racks glow blue with Windows logos. On the right, server racks glow orange with Linux penguin logos. Silhouettes of IT workers are seen on both sides, portraying a competitive environment.
13.(78.02-87.00)- A dramatic, stylized image of a 3D male silhouette in a suit pointing angrily at a Linux penguin logo. The logo is visually represented as a dark, creeping "cancerous" growth that is trying to envelop a glowing Windows logo.
14.(87.00-91.30)- In a dark and moody scene, a silhouette figure dressed as a knight, with a shield bearing the Windows logo, raises a glowing sword to strike down a stylized representation of the Linux penguin, portraying it as a monster to be slain.
15.(91.30-96.78)- A complete tonal shift from the previous scene. The background is now bright and clean. A silhouette representing the new Microsoft extends a hand in a gesture of partnership towards the Linux penguin, which is now depicted as a neutral character, not a monster.
16.(96.78-99.80)- A simple, clean graphic animation. The Microsoft Azure (cloud) logo appears on screen. A "+" symbol animates in, followed by the Linux penguin logo. They combine and transform into a single icon showing the two logos side-by-side with a green checkmark.
17.(99.80-105.50)- An animation showing a large, intricate digital puzzle forming the Linux penguin logo. Many faceless developer silhouettes are adding pieces. A prominent silhouette with a Microsoft logo on its shirt flies in and adds a crucial, glowing piece to the puzzle, signifying contribution.
18.(105.50-116.52)- A motion graphic showing a computer screen with the Windows 10 interface. A command line terminal window opens up, displaying the classic Linux prompt. A visual effect shows the Windows logo and the Linux penguin logo merging together inside the screen.
19.(116.52-123.62)- Returning to the cathedral metaphor, an old-guard silhouette in priest-like robes drops a book in shock. He is staring at the altar where the Windows logo and the Linux penguin logo are now intertwined and glowing together, an act of "heresy".
20.(123.62-131.78)- A wide shot of a large crowd of developer silhouettes. In the foreground, a few with "Old Microsoft" shirts look shocked and dismayed. The vast majority of the crowd, however, is looking up attentively and with approval at a giant screen.
21.(131.78-140.20)- A close-up of the giant screen from the previous scene. It shows the Microsoft logo with open arms, offering icons for "Tools" and "Cloud" towards a circle of other logos, including Apple, Android, and the Linux Penguin. The text reads: "We are not your enemy."
22.(140.20-150.68)- A powerful animation of a large brick wall with "WINDOWS FIRST RELIGION" painted on it. A silhouette of a leader crashes through it. As the wall crumbles, it reveals a vast, new, colorful world full of diverse developer and customer silhouettes who now turn to look with interest.
23.(150.68-155.18)- A final split-screen comparison. On the left, labeled "Dying Monopoly," is a single, large but wilting plant with a Windows logo in a constricting pot. On the right, labeled "Thriving Ecosystem," is a vibrant, interconnected digital garden with many different types of glowing plants (representing various platforms and services) growing together. The Microsoft logo is just one of many healthy plants in this garden.
