1. (0.00 - 5.82) - A towering 3D character with an angular head stands on a monolithic pedestal, its pose rigid and commanding, like a deity. In the dark, geometric temple-like environment, a singular, glowing "Windows" symbol shines down from above in parallax.

2. (5.82 - 14.74) - An angular character stands in a confident, questioning pose with a hand on its hip, looking down a single, brightly lit data path. The surrounding cyberpunk cityscape is dark, with all other potential paths remaining unlit and ignored in the parallax background.

3. (14.74 - 20.68) - A massive, glowing geometric sun representing Windows dominates a digital cosmos. Tiny, angular planet-like characters orbit it in rigid paths, their poses suggesting they are being pulled helplessly by its immense gravity.

4. (20.68 - 29.96) - A stiff, angular character stands with its back turned in a pose of stubborn refusal towards three glowing portals labeled 'Internet', 'Search', and 'Mobile'. A second, more dynamic character strides forward, shattering a glowing Windows icon with a decisive swing of a geometric hammer.

5. (29.96 - 46.90) - An isolated angular character stands on a small, crumbling platform, its pose defensive and overwhelmed. It's surrounded by a swirling sea of diverse, glowing device icons (iPhones, Androids) in a vast, dark parallax space.

6. (46.90 - 60.98) - A sleek angular character executes a dynamic flip, landing in a new, open-armed stance. From its outstretched hands, glowing data streams shoot out across a neon-noir cityscape, connecting to a constellation of different device silhouettes in the background.

7. (60.98 - 78.02) - Two angular characters, one glowing blue (Windows) and one orange (Linux), face off in a hostile, confrontational stance on opposite sides of a digital chasm inside a glitching, parallax server farm.

8. (78.02 - 96.78) - An aggressive angular character (Ballmer) points an accusatory finger in a furious pose. The scene shifts to a new character (Nadella) who steps forward, extending its hand to the opposing figure in a surprising, embracing gesture of unity.

9. (96.78 - 116.52) - The two formerly opposed blue and orange characters now stand side-by-side, their poses synchronized and collaborative. They are building a new, complex geometric structure, with the orange character's energy flowing into and merging with the blue one's form.

10. (116.52 - 131.78) - A crowd of older, rigid angular figures recoil in dramatic poses of shock and disbelief. In front of them, a single modern character stands on a podium, arms open wide, broadcasting a powerful, clear signal to the vast developer community in the parallax background.

11. (131.78 - 140.20) - A single angular character stands with a welcoming, open-armed posture at the end of a neon alley. It projects holographic tool and cloud icons from its hands towards a crowd of figures who are cautiously emerging from the shadows.

12. (140.20 - 155.18) - An angular character turns its back on a crumbling, monolithic throne in a dark room, its pose one of finality. It pushes open a large door, revealing a vast, thriving ecosystem—a bright, interconnected cyberpunk city full of countless active figures.
