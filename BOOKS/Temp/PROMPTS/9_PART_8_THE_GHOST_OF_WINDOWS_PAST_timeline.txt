1. (0.00 - 5.82) - A lone 3D male silhouette stands in a vast, dark hall, looking up at a giant, glowing blue Windows logo that resembles a cathedral window. Heavy blue fog swirls around his feet. Parallax effect: silhouette in the foreground, fog in the midground, logo in the background.

2. (6.66 - 14.74) - In a dark boardroom, several 3D silhouettes sit around a long table. In the center, a blue holographic Windows logo glows, and all silhouettes are pointing towards it as if in prayer.

3. (15.44 - 20.68) - A massive, glowing blue Windows logo shines like a sun in the blackness of space. A tiny 3D silhouette on a small, rocky planetoid is seen slowly orbiting it.

4. (21.24 - 26.26) - A 3D silhouette is fixated on a glowing blue screen. In the hazy background, ghostly, out-of-focus images of a smartphone and a search bar drift by unnoticed.

5. (26.90 - 31.84) - A new 3D silhouette holds a hammer, standing before the giant, cathedral-like Windows logo, which now has a large crack running through it. The blue fog is beginning to clear, showing a neutral grey background.

6. (32.32 - 40.22) - An expansive, dark landscape is filled with hundreds of small, glowing rectangles representing various phones and laptops. A single, lonely desktop PC with a classic blue screen stands isolated among them.

7. (40.84 - 46.90) - A 3D silhouette struggles to pull a wooden cart, but it's tethered by a thick rope to a massive, square stone block with a Windows logo carved into it. In the background, a streak of light representing a modern car speeds past.

8. (47.74 - 54.12) - A 3D silhouette decisively pushes over a tall stone pillar, causing the glowing blue Windows logo that was on top to topple off its pedestal. The scene is lit with a stark, white light.

9. (54.68 - 60.98) - From a central 3D silhouette, glowing lines of multi-colored light (blue, green, red, yellow) extend outwards, connecting to a constellation of floating devices: a phone, a laptop, and a server rack.

10. (61.48 - 69.02) - Two 3D silhouettes stand on opposing cliffs. One cliff is marked with a glowing blue Windows logo, the other with a green penguin logo for Linux. A thick fog fills the chasm between them.

11. (78.66 - 91.30) - A 3D silhouette stands on a stage, pointing an accusatory finger down at a single, small green penguin logo sitting alone in a vast, dark auditorium. The entire scene is bathed in an aggressive, deep blue light.

12. (92.20 - 96.78) - A 3D silhouette extends a hand in a handshake gesture across the chasm, which is now spanned by a simple, clean bridge of light. The fog has completely vanished.

13. (97.12 - 116.52) - A close-up of a 3D silhouette’s hands working on a computer. On the blue Windows 10 screen, a terminal window is open, glowing with classic green Linux command-line text.

14. (117.08 - 123.62) - A 3D silhouette dressed in an old-fashioned suit recoils in shock, looking at the computer screen from the previous shot as if it's an act of heresy. The room is lit with a dim, foreboding blue light.

15. (124.22 - 131.78) - A 3D silhouette stands before a giant blackboard, erasing a "VERSUS" sign between the Windows logo and the Linux penguin logo. The background is clean and white.

16. (132.34 - 155.18) - A parched, cracked desert floor has a single, wilting blue flower. A 3D silhouette pours water from a can, and a vibrant, multi-colored ecosystem of plants and flowers instantly grows and spreads across the landscape.
