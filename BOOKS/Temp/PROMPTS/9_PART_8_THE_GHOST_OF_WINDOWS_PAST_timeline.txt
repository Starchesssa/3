1.  **(0.00 - 5.82)** - A vast, dark, digital space. In the background, a massive, glowing, old Windows 95 logo shines like a sun, casting long shadows. In the midground, a single 3D male silhouette in a suit kneels before the logo as if at an altar. In the foreground, lines of archaic code and pixels drift slowly across the screen, creating a deep parallax effect. The words "ONE RELIGION" are stenciled in a stark, white font over the image.

2.  **(5.82 - 12.74)** - A quick-cut montage.
    *   **Shot 1:** An industrial conveyor belt (midground) carries boxes labeled "OFFICE," "XBOX," and "SERVER." A giant, robotic stamping arm (foreground) slams down, branding each box with a Windows logo. Sparks fly with each impact.
    *   **Shot 2:** A dark boardroom. Silhouetted figures sit around a long table (foreground). On a huge screen in the background, a complex flowchart is shown, but every single path and arrow ultimately points to a single, glowing Windows icon at the center.

3.  **(12.74 - 14.74)** - Close-up on the boardroom projector screen from the previous shot. The camera pushes in slowly. The question, "HOW DOES THIS HELP WINDOWS?" is typed out in a heavy, imposing, block-like font. The glow from the screen flickers across the faces of the out-of-focus silhouettes in the foreground.

4.  **(14.74 - 20.68)** - A stylized solar system. The glowing Windows logo is a fiery, central sun. In the midground, small, grey planets labeled "Office," "Hardware," and "Server" revolve around it in rigid, perfect orbits. In the foreground, digital asteroids and debris drift by, enhancing the parallax depth. The entire system feels self-contained and isolated against a black, starless void.

5.  **(20.68 - 26.26)** - The same Windows solar system. In the far background, three brilliant comets labeled "INTERNET," "SEARCH," and "MOBILE" streak across the void at high speed. The planets orbiting the Windows sun do not deviate from their paths; their gravitational pull seems to ignore the comets completely. The camera focuses on the planets, letting the massive opportunities in the background fly by, almost unnoticed.

6.  **(26.26 - 29.96)** - We see the altar from the first scene. A new, different silhouette (Nadella) walks into the frame (midground). He looks at the glowing Windows icon, then firmly grasps a large, industrial lever (foreground). As he pulls it down, the Windows "sun" begins to flicker violently and dim. The on-screen text "A RELIGION HAD TO DIE" fades in and out.

7.  **(29.96 - 40.22)** - A dynamic split-screen. On the left, an old, beige PC tower in a drab cubicle. On the right, a vibrant, flowing collage of disembodied hands using sleek iPhones, Android tablets, Macbooks, and Chromebooks. The collage on the right aggressively expands, cracking the left screen and pushing the old PC image out of the frame until only the modern devices remain.

8.  **(40.22 - 46.90)** - A stylized, sepia-toned scene. In the midground, a silhouette struggles to hitch a giant, heavy carriage labeled "THE FUTURE" to a single, tired-looking horse wearing a Windows logo blanket. In the background, a sleek, futuristic car, glowing with neon light, speeds past on a highway, leaving the horse and carriage behind in a cloud of dust that blows across the foreground.

9.  **(46.90 - 54.12)** - The Nadella silhouette stands before a massive, complex blueprint titled "WINDOWS FIRST STRATEGY." He grabs the blueprint, rips it clean off the wall, flips it upside down, and slaps it back on. The intricate lines of the drawing rearrange themselves into a new, more open pattern. The "WINDOWS FIRST" title at the top glitches and shatters.

10. **(54.12 - 60.98)** - A schematic animation. A central hub labeled "MICROSOFT SERVICES" appears. Luminous blue lines of data shoot out from it, traveling across a dark map of the world in the background. In the midground, these lines connect to the glowing outlines of every type of device—phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops from multiple brands. As each connection is made, the device lights up. Data particles stream past the camera in the foreground.

11. **(60.98 - 69.02)** - Extreme close-up on the profile of a silhouette's head. Inside, we see a complex set of rusty, grinding gears labeled "WINDOWS." The gears shatter into pieces. From the fragments, a new, fluid, and interconnected system of light and energy forms. The camera pulls back to reveal the silhouette is now looking at a glowing icon of the Linux penguin, Tux.

12. **(69.02 - 87.00)** - A dark stage. A single, aggressive silhouette (Ballmer) is in the midground, gesturing wildly at a podium. In the background, a screen shows the Linux penguin logo. As he speaks, animated, cancerous black cells bloom from the corner of the screen, slowly starting to consume the penguin logo. The quote "LINUX IS A CANCER" flashes in a corrupted, glitchy font in the foreground.

13. **(87.00 - 96.78)** - The "cancer" animation freezes and shatters like broken glass. The scene is replaced by a bright, clean space. The Nadella silhouette stands on one side, the Linux penguin logo on the other. The silhouette extends a hand, which transforms into a bridge of light connecting to the logo. The bridge solidifies, showing two-way traffic of data packets.

14. **(96.78 - 105.50)** - An animated sequence. The Microsoft Azure cloud logo (midground) opens up like a hangar door. The Linux penguin logo, stylized as a friendly robot, walks inside. The scene then cuts to a visual of lines of code flowing like a river from a building with a Microsoft logo into a vast, open-source lake in the background, where hundreds of other developer silhouettes are working.

15. **(105.50 - 116.52)** - A stylized animation of a Windows 10 desktop. In the midground, a command prompt terminal is open. A silhouette's hands (foreground) type a Linux command (`sudo apt-get install`...). In the background, the iconic Windows wallpaper slowly dissolves, revealing a subtle, underlying wireframe of the Linux penguin, as if the two systems have merged.

16. **(116.52 - 123.62)** - The scene of the "Windows Religion" altar returns. We see a stained-glass window depicting the classic four-pane Windows logo. A rock, inscribed with the letters "WSL," flies in from off-screen in slow motion, shattering the stained glass into a thousand brilliant, falling pieces. The word "HERESY" is scrawled across the screen for a brief moment.

17. **(123.62 - 134.72)** - A split view. On the left, several silhouettes in old-fashioned suits stand with their jaws dropped in shock, bathed in a cold, blue light. On the right, a much larger, more diverse crowd of developer silhouettes, bathed in a warm, welcoming light, turn their heads and begin to nod in approval. A neon sign in the center flashes: "ENEMY > ALLY."

18. **(134.72 - 148.28)** - An animated blueprint unfurls. A central toolkit labeled "OUR TOOLS" (with smaller icons for Azure, VS Code, GitHub) is shown. Lines extend from the toolkit to various device schematics—a MacBook, a server rack with a Linux logo, and an Android phone. Silhouettes are shown working on all of them, using the same central set of tools. In the background, a massive wall with the old, monolithic Windows logo crumbles into dust.

19. **(148.28 - 155.18)** - Final shot. In the midground, a single, ornate, but cracking and decaying throne labeled "MONOPOLY" dissolves into particles of light. From these particles, a vibrant digital forest grows rapidly in its place. The trees are made of glowing code, and data flows like rivers between them. Various tech logos (Apple, Google, Linux) appear as glowing fruit on the branches, all interconnected, forming a thriving, symbiotic ecosystem that stretches to a bright horizon in the background.
