1. (0.00 - 5.82) - **Parallax effect**: A vast, cathedral-like hall. In the foreground, dozens of 2D male silhouettes are on their knees, heads bowed. In the far background, a massive, stained-glass window shaped like the classic Windows logo glows with an intense, divine light, casting long shadows from the silhouettes. The glowing window seems immense and distant, creating depth.

2. (6.66 - 12.74) - **Parallax effect**: A dark, circular boardroom. In the center, a 3D holographic Windows logo spins slowly, illuminating the faces of the silhouettes seated around the table. Floating in the mid-ground, between the silhouettes and the logo, are translucent blueprints and strategy charts, all pointing inward towards the central logo. The hologram spins at a different speed than the orbiting charts.

3. (13.36 - 14.74) - **Parallax effect**: A tight, dramatic close-up on the side of a silhouette's head. The question "How does this help WINDOWS?" is projected across his featureless face and the wall behind him. The word "WINDOWS" glows brighter than the rest. The text on the wall moves slightly slower than the text on the silhouette's face, creating a sense of depth and focus.

4. (15.44 - 20.68) - **Parallax effect**: An astronomical scene. In the center is a giant, fiery sun in the shape of the Windows logo. Orbiting it in the mid-ground are tiny, insignificant planets labeled "Office," "Xbox," and "Server." The camera slowly pushes in, making the "sun" feel overwhelmingly large as the tiny planets orbit at different speeds.

5. (21.24 - 26.26) - **Parallax effect**: A triptych of failure. Three panels are shown. Left: Silhouettes with their backs turned to a glowing, complex neural network representing "The Internet." Center: A silhouette walks past a giant, pulsating search bar they don't notice. Right: A smartphone falls from a silhouette's hand and shatters on the floor. In each panel, the background element is static while the silhouettes move past in the foreground, emphasizing their obliviousness.

6. (26.90 - 29.96) - **Parallax effect**: A lone 3D silhouette stands before the massive, cracking stained-glass Windows logo from the first scene. The divine light is now flickering violently. In the foreground, small pieces of glass begin to fall and drift slowly towards the camera, out of focus.

7. (30.52 - 40.22) - **Parallax effect**: The camera pans across a vast sea of glowing screens that fill the frame. In the foreground, sharp and bright screens of iPhones, Macbooks, and Android tablets dominate. In the far, hazy background, a single, lonely Windows PC screen is visible, looking outdated and overwhelmed by the sheer number of other devices.

8. (40.84 - 46.90) - **Parallax effect**: A stylized, sepia-toned image. In the foreground, a 2D silhouette struggles to hitch a modern, glass skyscraper (labeled "Microsoft") to a tired-looking horse. In the background, sleek, futuristic cars (labeled "Apple," "Google") speed past on a highway, their light trails streaking across the scene.

9. (47.74 - 54.12) - **Parallax effect**: The previous astronomical scene is flipped on its head. In the background, the Windows "sun" has shrunk to the size of a normal planet. In the foreground and mid-ground, other celestial bodies labeled "Azure," "Cloud," and "Office" have grown massive and now form a new, complex solar system. A silhouette stands in the center, conducting the cosmic rearrangement like an orchestra conductor.

10. (54.68 - 60.98) - **Parallax effect**: A stylized globe of the Earth is in the background. In the foreground, a rain of glowing app icons (Word, Excel, Teams, Azure) falls from the sky. The icons land on a variety of devices (iPhones, Androids, Laptops) held by silhouettes, integrating seamlessly. The icons in the foreground are larger and fall faster, creating a 3D rain effect.

11. (61.48 - 69.02) - **Parallax effect**: Two colossal, opposing stone statues face each other across a chasm. One is carved into a Windows logo, the other into the Linux penguin mascot, Tux. A glowing bridge of light forms between them in the mid-ground, and a single silhouette begins to walk across it. The camera slowly orbits the scene, making the chasm feel deep and the statues immense.

12. (69.72 - 87.00) - **Parallax effect**: A silhouette of a shouting executive (Ballmer). From his mouth, the word "CANCER" emerges in a sickly, green, dripping font. The word grows like a malignant vine in the foreground, attempting to wrap around and choke a small, glowing orange Linux penguin icon in the background.

13. (87.50 - 96.78) - **Parallax effect**: A split-screen, before-and-after shot. On the left ("Before"), a silhouette general orders an army of blue Windows-logo soldiers to charge an army of orange penguin soldiers under a stormy sky. On the right ("After"), the battlefield is now a green field under a sunny sky. A silhouette (Nadella) is shaking hands with a penguin-headed silhouette as the two logos orbit each other peacefully in the background.

14. (97.12 - 116.52) - **Parallax effect**: A stylized view of the Windows 10 desktop in the background. In the foreground, a translucent command prompt window opens. A silhouette's hands are typing, and Linux commands (`ls -la`, `grep`, `awk`) appear, running natively. The Linux penguin icon peeks out from behind the command prompt window, giving a subtle nod. The command prompt appears to float in front of the desktop.

15. (117.08 - 123.62) - **Parallax effect**: The "cathedral" from the beginning. The massive stained-glass Windows logo is now completely shattered. In the foreground, a lone silhouette is sweeping up the broken, glowing shards of glass. Through the gaping hole where the window was, a bright, thriving, modern city can be seen in the distant background.

16. (124.22 - 131.78) - **Parallax effect**: A group of rigid, "old-school" silhouettes stand in the shadowed foreground on the left, looking shocked. On the right, bathed in light, a diverse crowd of "developer" silhouettes look on with interest and approval. Between them, in the mid-ground, the glowing message "Microsoft is not your enemy" hangs in the air.

17. (132.34 - 140.20) - **Parallax effect**: A single developer silhouette sits at a desk in the center. In the foreground and mid-ground, an ecosystem of tool icons (VS Code, GitHub, Azure) orbit them like satellites. These satellites shoot out lines of light that connect to a ring of platform logos (Apple, Android, Linux) in the far background.

18. (140.88 - 155.18) - **Parallax effect**: In the foreground, a gilded, ornate, but cracking birdcage labeled "WINDOWS MONOPOLY" shatters and dissolves. The pieces transform into a flock of birds that fly into the background. As they fly, they merge with the landscape, transforming it into a vibrant, interconnected digital forest, a thriving ecosystem where all tech logos grow together on the trees.
