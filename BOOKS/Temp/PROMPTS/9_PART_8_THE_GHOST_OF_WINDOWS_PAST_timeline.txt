1.  **(0.00-5.82)** - A dark, cavernous boardroom where a single, massive screen on the far wall glows intensely with the classic Windows logo. In the midground, 2D silhouettes of executives are seated around a long table, all looking up at the logo as if it were a sacred object. The camera slowly pushes in towards the logo.
    *   **Parallax effect:** **Foreground:** The polished, reflective edge of the boardroom table, slightly out of focus. **Midground:** The silhouettes of the executives. **Background:** The immense, glowing Windows logo.

2.  **(6.66-14.74)** - A shot of a large, semi-transparent glass wall in an office. A complex flowchart is drawn on it, showing various corporate initiatives like "Office," "Hardware," and "Server." All lines and arrows from these initiatives converge on a single, dominant central box labeled "WINDOWS." A 3D manager silhouette points firmly at this central box while addressing other silhouettes.
    *   **Parallax effect:** **Foreground:** The out-of-focus silhouette of another employee working at a desk. **Midground:** The manager and other silhouettes at the glass flowchart wall. **Background:** The blurred lights and shapes of the deeper office space.

3.  **(15.44-26.26)** - A stylized animation of a solar system where a brightly glowing Windows logo serves as the sun. Suddenly, three objects representing new technologies—a globe icon for "Internet," a magnifying glass for "Search," and a smartphone outline for "Mobile"—streak across the background like comets, completely ignored by the planets orbiting the Windows "sun."
    *   **Parallax effect:** **Foreground:** One of the orbiting planets (labeled "Office") swings close to the camera. **Midground:** The central Windows logo "sun." **Background:** The distant comets of missed technology streaking through space.

4.  **(26.90-40.22)** - A 3D silhouette representing the new CEO stands at a large office window, looking out at a sprawling city at night. The camera slowly zooms towards the city, revealing that inside the countless illuminated windows of other buildings, other small silhouettes are actively using a variety of devices—the distinct shapes of iPhones, Android tablets, and Macbooks are visible.
    *   **Parallax effect:** **Foreground:** The CEO silhouette, seen from behind. **Midground:** The frame of the large office window. **Background:** The vast, detailed cityscape with animated silhouettes in the windows of distant buildings.

5.  **(40.84-51.18)** - A split-screen comparison. On the left, a stylized animation of a horse with a "Windows" brand on its side stands stubbornly on an old dirt road. On the right, a sleek, modern car speeds down a highway. The scene transitions to a 3D silhouette's hand decisively flipping a large, industrial-style switch on a control panel from "WINDOWS FIRST" to "CLOUD FIRST."
    *   **Parallax effect:** **Foreground:** Dust kicked up from the dirt road on the left / motion blur lines from the highway on the right. **Midground:** The horse and the car / the control panel. **Background:** A static, old-timey landscape / a moving, modern cityscape.

6.  **(51.18-60.98)** - An animated graphic where the Microsoft Azure cloud logo is at the center. Lines of light representing services shoot outwards from it, connecting to the outlines of various devices—a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop, and a server rack—which light up upon connection over a stylized world map.
    *   **Parallax effect:** **Foreground:** Lines of light and data packets that fly towards the camera before hitting their targets. **Midground:** The device outlines and central Azure logo. **Background:** A spinning globe with glowing connection points.

7.  **(64.86-78.02)** - Inside a vast, stylized server room, a 2D silhouette stands between two opposing server racks. One rack glows blue with a prominent Windows logo, while the other glows orange with the Linux penguin mascot. The silhouette extends a hand, and a bridge of light connects the two previously competing systems.
    *   **Parallax effect:** **Foreground:** The corner of a server rack with blinking LED lights, slightly out of focus. **Midground:** The central silhouette forming the bridge of light. **Background:** Rows of identical server racks fading into the deep blue darkness of the data center.

8.  **(78.66-91.30)** - An aggressive, energetic 3D silhouette stands on a conference stage at a podium. On the giant screen behind him, the friendly Linux penguin logo is shown with a pulsating, red graphic resembling a cancer cell overlaid on it, visually representing the "threat."
    *   **Parallax effect:** **Foreground:** The out-of-focus heads of audience silhouettes watching the presentation. **Midground:** The animated speaker silhouette at the podium. **Background:** The large presentation screen displaying the hostile graphic.

9.  **(92.20-105.50)** - The scene shifts to a clean, modern animation on a computer monitor. The hostile red graphic from the previous scene dissolves. Then, the Windows logo and the Linux penguin logo slide in from opposite sides of the screen and join with a "plus" sign appearing between them. Lines of code are shown flowing from a Microsoft repository to an open-source repository.
    *   **Parallax effect:** **Foreground:** A 3D silhouette's hand resting on a computer mouse. **Midground:** The monitor displaying the "embrace" animation. **Background:** A bright, minimalist office environment.

10. **(105.91-123.62)** - A stylized view of a Windows 10 desktop. A command prompt window opens in the center of the screen. Inside the text-based interface, the Linux penguin mascot is drawn with ASCII characters, and it gives a friendly wink. Faint, ghostly reflections of shocked 2D silhouettes can be seen on the surface of the monitor.
    *   **Parallax effect:** **Foreground:** The icons on the Windows taskbar, slightly blurred. **Midground:** The command prompt window with the animated ASCII art. **Background:** The blurred desktop wallpaper and the faint, shocked reflections.

11. **(124.22-134.72)** - A wide shot of a massive developer conference. A lone 3D silhouette on stage is dwarfed by the screen behind him, which displays a simple, powerful message: "Microsoft ❤️ Developers". Below the text are the logos for Windows, Apple, Android, and Linux, all given equal prominence.
    *   **Parallax effect:** **Foreground:** The backs of several rows of audience silhouettes, some holding up glowing laptops. **Midground:** The speaker on the illuminated stage. **Background:** The enormous, brightly lit presentation screen.

12. **(135.16-155.18)** - A final, metaphorical shot. A large, stone throne with a cracked "W" symbol on it crumbles into dust. From the dust, a vibrant digital tree grows rapidly. Its branches are formed from the logos of different operating systems, and its leaves are glowing icons for Microsoft's cloud services. Silhouettes of developers and customers gather around the thriving tree.
    *   **Parallax effect:** **Foreground:** Particles of the crumbling stone throne floating past the camera. **Midground:** The growing digital tree and the gathering silhouettes. **Background:** A bright, optimistic sky filled with abstract data streams.
