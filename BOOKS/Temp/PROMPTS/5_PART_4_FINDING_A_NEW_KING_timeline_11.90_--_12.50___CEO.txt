**11.90 – 17.60:** A chaotic corporate boardroom reimagined as a three-ring circus. Business executives in suits are juggling flaming laptops and walking on tightropes made of ethernet cables. In the center, a ringmaster gestures wildly at a plummeting stock chart. The mood is one of controlled chaos and high drama.

**18.30 – 22.06:** Dramatic, low-key lighting in a sleek, modern boardroom. A group of anxious-looking board members huddle together, their faces illuminated by a glowing conference table displaying a complex, unsolvable maze. Chairman John Thompson stands at the head, looking stressed but determined.

**22.68 – 25.32:** Symbolic image of a massive, brutalist-style concrete building labeled "Old Microsoft" cracking and crumbling. From the cracks, vibrant light and green shoots of a new, organic structure emerge, representing radical change and new growth.

**27.50 – 29.30:** A vast, dark room dominated by a holographic world map. From a central point labeled "MSFT," glowing lines of light radiate outwards, scanning across continents, highlighting various anonymous silhouettes of potential leaders. The feeling is of a desperate, wide-ranging global search.

**31.64 – 36.84:** A lone figure in bright, clean clothes stands on a sunlit precipice, looking down into a valley. The valley contains a sprawling corporate campus shrouded in a sickly, green-tinted fog labeled "culture." The figure represents a clean break, an untainted outsider.

**37.46 – 40.80:** A close-up on a cluttered whiteboard in a boardroom. The board is filled with brainstormed names, flowcharts, and diagrams, but a single, powerful spotlight illuminates one name written clearly and boldly in the center: "ALAN MULALLY".
