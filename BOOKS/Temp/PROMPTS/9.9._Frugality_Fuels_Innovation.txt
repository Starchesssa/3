1. An infographic showing a stream of glowing golden coins being filtered. Some coins are directed towards a radiant, stylized icon of a happy customer, while other coins are diverted into a dark void labeled "WASTE". Kurzgesagt style, vibrant colors on a dark background.

2. An abstract visualization of a complex, dark, jagged labyrinth representing a problem. A single, brilliant, neon-blue line elegantly carves a simple, direct path through the labyrinth, glowing brightly to symbolize a clever solution. Flat design, Kurzgesagt style.

3. A minimalist, futuristic icon of an overly-designed office desk with unnecessary glowing panels. Next to it, a large, vibrant, orange price tag icon displays "$300". Simple, clean infographic on a grid background, Kurzgesagt style.

4. An exploded-view diagram showing a simple, flat icon of a wooden door in the center, with four simple cylindrical leg icons positioned below it. Plus signs and arrows indicate assembly, with small price tags showing "$30" and "$20". Kurzgesagt style.

5. A fully assembled, starkly simple "door desk" icon, composed of clean geometric shapes. A single, large, glowing green price tag next to it prominently displays "$50". Bright, colorful vector illustration, Kurzgesagt style.

6. An abstract, dynamic composition of floating, glowing mathematical symbols: plus, minus, percentage signs, and numbers. The symbols are connected by faint lines of light on a deep blue cosmic background. Kurzgesagt style.

7. A clean bar graph infographic. One tall, dark bar is labeled "$300". Next to it is a very short, bright green bar labeled "$50". A glowing bracket highlights the massive difference, with the text "83% REDUCTION" displayed clearly. Kurzgesagt style.

8. A simple infographic showing an icon of a single saved coin labeled "$250". An arrow with "x 100" points from the coin to a large, radiant pile of stylized golden coins with the number "$25,000" glowing above it. Kurzgesagt style.

9. A small, glowing, simple gear on the left, meshing with and turning a series of progressively larger and more complex gears. The final gear on the right is enormous and powers a radiant orb of light, symbolizing massive innovation. Kurzgesagt style.

10. A stylized icon of a sleek, monolithic, expensive-looking server rack. A large, bold, red 'X' is superimposed over the icon, clearly communicating rejection. Simple, flat design on a tech-themed background, Kurzgesagt style.

11. An exploded diagram of a server built from simple, generic, brightly-colored blocks and cylinders, like building blocks. A circular graphic nearby is 40% filled with a vibrant color, labeled "40% COST CUT". Kurzgesagt style.

12. A vibrant flowchart. A large pile of glowing "SAVINGS" coins flows down a tube that splits, sending smaller coins to numerous abstract customer icons. These icons then send glowing lines of energy back to a central, rapidly growing, crystalline structure. Kurzgesagt style.

13. A powerful visual metaphor. On the left, a single, small, glowing seed is planted. On the right, growing from it is a massive, complex, and brilliantly illuminated "innovation tree" made of interconnected geometric shapes and circuits of light. Kurzgesagt style.
