1. (0.00-7.58) - A 2D parallax view. In the foreground, a lone male silhouette stands on a precipice, looking out. In the mid-ground, a colossal, glowing, cloud-like structure with the letters "AWS" faintly visible dominates the horizon, representing a massive, immovable force. In the far background, a dark, starless sky slowly pans, creating a sense of immense scale and depth.

2. (7.58-14.21) - A parallax shot inside a dimly lit boardroom. A male silhouette, representing a leader, stands in the foreground, gesturing towards a large window. Through the window, the looming "AWS" cloud structure from the previous scene is visible. In the mid-ground, several other male silhouettes are seated around a table, their faces turned towards the leader. As the camera slowly pushes in, the foreground silhouette moves against the background, emphasizing his attempt to make the others "understand" the scale of the challenge.

3. (14.21-21.75) - A 2D/3D parallax scene inside a server room. In the foreground, a male silhouette technician is working on a physical server rack. In the mid-ground, rows of similar server racks stretch into a vanishing point, their blinking lights creating a rhythmic pattern. In the background, a large digital calendar on a wall displays the year "2010". The camera tracks slowly to the side, causing the foreground technician to move quickly across the frame while the background calendar remains more static, firmly rooting the scene in the "early 2010s".
