1. (0.00-10.86) - a geometric vector illustration style of a middle-aged male silhouette in a dark suit, depicted in a split-screen parallax view. On the left, he's authoritatively dropping a broken smartphone into a bin. On the right, he's kneeling, carefully pouring liquid from a can onto a small, growing fire on the floor of a minimalist office.

2. (10.86-17.18) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male silhouette in a business suit, standing and looking up in awe. Before him, a massive, stylized cloud made of digital circuits glows intensely. The word "AZURE" is integrated into the cloud's structure, shining brightly from within the parallax digital landscape.

3. (17.18-23.38) - a geometric vector illustration style of a smaller male silhouette in a suit at the base of a huge mountain, looking up with determination. At the very peak stands a much larger, imposing silhouette. A glowing "AWS" logo marks the peak, while a smaller "Azure" logo glows beside the character at the bottom. The scene is in parallax.

4. (23.38-35.02) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male silhouette in a blazer and jeans, sitting confidently on a large throne constructed from glowing server racks. He overlooks a vast digital city. Above the throne, the "AWS" logo shines like a crown. On the wall behind him are the words "HEAD START". The scene has a parallax effect.

5. (35.02-43.68) - a geometric vector illustration style of a group of male silhouettes in suits huddled around a large boardroom table, intensely focused on glowing "Windows" and "Office" logos projected on it. In a dark corner of the room, a single, small server rack with a faint "Azure" logo is completely ignored. The room has large windows showing a cityscape in parallax.

6. (43.68-53.66) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male silhouette in a suit, turning his back on a group of colleagues focused on a table. He is looking intently at a small, glowing server in the corner. A beam of light projects from his blank head towards the server, revealing a vision of a massive, futuristic city inside it. The word "FUTURE" is faintly visible on the wall in the light beam, all in parallax.

7. (53.66-63.98) - a geometric vector illustration style of multiple male silhouettes pushing old, clunky server racks off the edge of a cliff. Across a wide chasm, enormous, sleek data centers rise into the clouds, with glowing bridges of light extending towards the silhouettes. The words "RENTING POWER" are written on the bridges of light. The background is a vast, open sky in parallax.

8. (63.98-74.08) - a geometric vector illustration style of two male silhouettes in suits standing on a giant chessboard floating in a digital void. One is on a crumbling square with the words "DESKTOP OS" fading on it. The other is on a large, glowing square with the word "CLOUD" shining brightly on the wall behind him. Both figures are poised for a strategic move, with a parallax background.

9. (74.08-84.60) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male silhouette in a CEO suit standing on a large stage, pushing a giant poker chip with a Microsoft logo towards the audience. Behind him, on a massive screen, the words "CLOUD FIRST" glow intensely inside a stylized cloud. The scene is in parallax.

10. (84.60-92.06) - a geometric vector illustration style of a central male silhouette in a suit, acting as a conductor. He directs glowing streams of currency symbols from all directions into a central, rapidly growing crystalline structure on the wall labeled "Azure." Around him, other silhouettes rearrange large blocks to support this central structure. The parallax background shows complex organizational charts morphing.

11. (92.06-100.06) - a geometric vector illustration style of a line of male silhouettes in sales suits on a conveyor belt. At one end, they discard old manuals with a "Windows" logo. At the other end, a robotic arm hands them new, glowing tablets displaying the "Azure" logo and consumption graphs. The background is a sleek, futuristic training facility in parallax.

12. (100.06-113.06) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male silhouette in a suit at the starting line of a race, looking at a competitor far ahead labeled "AWS." Instead of the track, the silhouette stands on a solid bridge made of countless interlocked hands that extends across the entire field, representing established corporate relationships. The parallax background is a massive stadium.

13. (113.06-128.64) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male silhouette in a suit confidently shaking hands with another corporate silhouette. The first silhouette offers a glowing key with the "Azure" logo. They stand before a massive skyscraper that already has "Windows" and "Office" logos integrated into its architecture. The scene is in parallax.

14. (128.64-138.98) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male silhouette in a suit riding a powerful rocket shaped like an upward-trending stock chart arrow. The rocket, labeled "Azure," soars vertically into a digital sky, leaving a fiery trail with "90%" and "100%" glowing on background walls they pass. The parallax background is a matrix of data.

15. (138.98-152.14) - a geometric vector illustration style of a winner's podium. A large silhouette stands casually on the "#1" spot. Another determined male silhouette has just finished a hard climb onto the "#2" spot, with the word "Azure" glowing on his chest. The word "IMPOSSIBLE" is seen shattered on the ground below the podium, all within a parallax stadium background.

16. (152.14-163.58) - a geometric vector illustration style of a triumphant male silhouette in a CEO suit standing before a massive, glowing industrial engine. The "Azure" logo is visible on the wall at the engine's core. The engine is powering the construction of a vast, futuristic city skyline behind it, with the tallest skyscraper featuring the Microsoft logo and dollar signs flowing through the parallax scene.
