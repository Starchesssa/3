1.(0.00-10.86)- A split-screen parallax effect. On the left, a 2D male silhouette throws a crumbling smartphone into a trash bin. On the right, the same silhouette kneels and pours gasoline from a can onto a small, smoldering fire, causing the flames to grow larger.

2.(10.86-17.18)- The fire from the previous scene morphs and expands into a large, glowing, abstract digital cloud. The word "AZURE" materializes within the cloud.

3.(17.18-23.38)- A David vs. Goliath scene. In the background, a massive, towering mountain is branded with the "AWS" logo. In the foreground, the smaller, glowing "AZURE" cloud faces it, representing the challenger.

4.(23.38-35.02)- A stylized, animated map of the digital world. The vast majority of the landmass is covered by the "AWS" logo, representing market dominance. A few tiny, isolated islands represent other competitors.

5.(35.02-43.68)- An office interior with many 3D male silhouettes working at desks with large, glowing "Windows" and "Office" logos above them. In a small, dark corner, a single silhouette tends to a tiny, faintly glowing "AZURE" cloud, looking ignored.

6.(43.68-53.66)- A close-up on the side of a male silhouette's head. Inside, a complex system of gears is shown, but at its center is the brightly glowing and expanding "AZURE" cloud, representing his singular vision.

7.(53.66-63.98)- A parallax effect showing a transition. The foreground shows 2D silhouettes moving physical server racks out of a basement. The background shows those servers connecting to a vast network of massive, floating data centers in the sky.

8.(63.98-74.08)- A desktop computer with an operating system logo fades into the background. In the foreground, two giant, abstract cloud shapes (one labeled "AWS", one "AZURE") clash like titans, with sparks flying.

9.(74.08-84.60)- A 3D male silhouette stands at a podium on a stage, pointing decisively at a giant screen behind him. The screen boldly displays the words "CLOUD FIRST, MOBILE FIRST" with corresponding icons.

10.(84.60-92.06)- An animation showing streams of glowing dollar sign icons flowing from a central building labeled "Microsoft" into a growing network of data centers labeled "AZURE". The building's internal structure visibly reorganizes around a central Azure core.

11.(92.06-100.06)- A row of 2D silhouettes sit in a classroom. On the screen in front of them, a "Windows License" document is erased and replaced by a rising line graph titled "Azure Consumption".

12.(100.06-108.76)- A cinematic shot of a race track. A huge vehicle labeled "AWS" is far in the lead. Far behind, a smaller vehicle labeled "AZURE" is shown with its engine glowing intensely as it begins to accelerate rapidly.

13.(108.76-118.20)- A stylized globe with the Microsoft logo at its center. Glowing lines extend from the logo to connect with hundreds of skyscraper icons representing major corporations all over the world.

14.(118.20-128.64)- A 2D silhouette representing Microsoft shakes hands with another silhouette representing a large corporation. In a speech bubble above them, server and email icons transform into a single, larger cloud icon, followed by a bright, affirmative checkmark.

15.(128.64-138.98)- A dynamic, animated bar chart. The bar for "AZURE" grows upwards at an explosive speed. Flashing numbers like "+90%" and "+100%" appear next to the bar with each "year" that passes in the background.

16.(138.98-152.14)- A winners' podium. The #1 spot is occupied by a large "AWS" block. A determined 3D silhouette is shown climbing onto the #2 spot, planting a flag with the "AZURE" logo on it.

17.(152.14-163.58)- A final, powerful parallax shot. A massive, gleaming engine with the "AZURE" logo on its side pulls a huge train labeled "MICROSOFT" up a steep incline. The train passes signs that read "$1 Trillion" and "$2 Trillion" as it powers forward into the clouds.
