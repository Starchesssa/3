8.(63.98-74.08)- a geometric vector illustration style of a strategic silhouette with an angular head, observing a giant, glowing chessboard in the sky where the main pieces are marked with "AZURE" and "AWS" logos, while an old, dusty chessboard with a fallen "WINDOWS" king piece sits forgotten in the foreground.
9.(74.08-84.60)- a geometric vector illustration style of a CEO silhouette with an angular head in a powerful pose, decisively pushing a giant poker chip labeled "MICROSOFT" all-in across a table, while the holographic words "CLOUD FIRST" illuminate the background.
10.(84.60-92.06)- a geometric vector illustration style of a silhouette in a suit with an angular head, posed like a conductor orchestrating streams of glowing dollar signs into a central, pulsating "AZURE" core, while architectural blocks around it reorganize and connect to the center.
11.(92.06-100.06)- a geometric vector illustration style of a line of sales silhouettes with angular heads on a conveyor belt, entering a machine labeled "WINDOWS" holding software boxes and exiting into an "AZURE" environment where they interact with glowing cloud interfaces, their poses changing from old-school to modern.
12.(100.06-113.06)- a geometric vector illustration style of a determined silhouette with an angular head climbing a steep mountain with the "AWS" flag far at the top; the silhouette holds a glowing key labeled "RELATIONSHIPS", representing a secret advantage for the difficult climb.
13.(113.06-128.64)- a geometric vector illustration style of two silhouettes in suits with angular heads, one representing Microsoft, shaking hands firmly with a corporate CEO, sealing a deal as the CEO's entire skyscraper headquarters is lifted onto a glowing "AZURE" cloud in the background.
14.(128.64-138.98)- a geometric vector illustration style of an exhilarated silhouette with an angular head, riding a rocket labeled "AZURE" that is blasting upwards, leaving a trail of exponential growth charts with "90%" and "100%" flashing in the background.
15.(138.98-152.14)- a geometric vector illustration style of a winner's podium, with a giant silhouette labeled "AWS" on the #1 spot, and a proud, hard-fought Azure silhouette standing strong on the #2 spot, as the word "IMPOSSIBLE" lies shattered on the ground below.
16.(152.14-163.58)- a geometric vector illustration style of a colossal Microsoft silhouette with an angular head standing tall, its chestplate open to reveal a powerful, glowing engine labeled "AZURE" powering its entire body, as a stock chart soars past the "TRILLION" dollar mark in the background.
