1. (0.00-10.86) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character with one arm slashing downwards through falling phone icons, while the other arm carefully pours a stream of light onto a single glowing ember on the ground, all in parallax.
2. (11.66-17.18) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character standing confidently, gesturing towards a massive, glowing, abstract cloud formation that resembles a controlled fire in a vast, dark space, all in parallax.
3. (17.50-23.38) - a geometric vector illustration style of a small character in a defiant fighting stance, looking up at a colossal, monolithic tower that casts a long shadow over them, all in parallax.
4. (24.28-35.02) - a geometric vector illustration style of a powerful character planting a glowing flag on the highest peak of a mountain range, surveying the vast territory below, all in parallax.
5. (35.66-43.68) - a geometric vector illustration style of a group of characters focused on a bright central cube, while one character looks away, dismissively waving at a small, faint glow in a dark corner, all in parallax.
6. (44.44-53.66) - a geometric vector illustration style of a lone character kneeling, protectively cupping their hands around a small, intensely glowing object on the floor of a dark, abstract room, all in parallax.
7. (54.04-63.98) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character in mid-stride, stepping off a crumbling platform of old servers and onto a bridge made of pure light leading to a floating city of data centers, all in parallax.
8. (64.54-74.08) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character, viewed from behind, pushing aside a small chessboard with desktop icons to focus on a much larger, floating chessboard with cloud-shaped pieces, all in parallax.
9. (74.08-84.60) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character standing on a podium, arm raised high to declare a new direction, pointing towards a massive, glowing cloud icon in the sky, all in parallax.
10. (85.06-92.06) - a geometric vector illustration style of a central character conducting streams of energy from all directions into a growing crystalline core, while other characters rearrange the architectural foundation around it, all in parallax.
11. (92.50-100.06) - a geometric vector illustration style of a line of characters turning in their old briefcases and receiving new, glowing orbs from a leader, their posture shifting to one of learning and adaptation, all in parallax.
12. (101.02-108.76) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character straining to push a massive boulder uphill, while a hidden network of glowing lines extends from their back, providing unseen power, all in parallax.
13. (109.38-118.20) - a geometric vector illustration style of two characters shaking hands, causing a vast network of light to erupt from them and connect to a distant skyline of corporate skyscrapers, all in parallax.
