(lost microsoft) - recreate the iconic 2007 image of steve jobs introducing the iphone, but the stage is lit in the chaotic, glitching colors of the microsoft brand, and the high-fashion 3d silhouette of a business figure holds up a nokia phone that is glitching and dissolving into pixels. (phone business) - the audience is composed of shadowed, despairing 3d silhouettes, bathed in a melancholic nokia blue light, their faces hidden in their gloved hands.

(two failing) - recreate the famous paypal mafia photo from the fortune magazine cover, but the group of high-fashion 3d male silhouettes are shackled together with glowing, broken data cables. (shackling themselves) - the background is a stark, brutalist hall lit by flickering, dying fluorescent lights in microsoft’s green and nokia's blue, with the crumbling logos of both companies on the wall behind them. (board was) - the figures look away from each other, their shadowed faces conveying immense tension and failure, their gloved hands clenched into fists.

(culture clash) - recreate jeff bezos's humble 1999 office, but transform it into a scene of opulent waste where faceless 3d business figures in high-fashion suits frantically shovel glowing data streams into a massive furnace shaped like a classic nokia phone. (burning through) - the room is on fire, with flames in the distinct red, green, blue, and yellow of the microsoft logo, casting long, distorted shadows of the figures. (shoveling more) - stacks of money, represented as glowing green data blocks, are piled high against the walls, also catching fire.

(epic world-class) - a single, high-fashion 3d silhouette of a business figure stands alone on a vast, cracked landscape made of shattered smartphones, resembling a desolate battlefield. (left the) - the sky above is a stormy vortex of microsoft's brand colors, and the only light comes from a massive bonfire in the distance, illuminating the wreckage and the solitary, defeated posture of the figure.
