(all this) - recreate the famous image of jeff bezzos in his 1999 office, but the office is filled with discarded windows phone hardware and the silhouette is surrounded by glowing blue and green light from a single monitor showing lines of code, the desk has a hand-sprayed microsoft logo instead of the amazon logo.
(company's culture) - a second high-fashion 3d silhouette in a dark suit with gloves stands in the doorway, back turned, representing the old guard leaving.

(hit refresh) - recreate the iconic fortune magazine photo of the paypal mafia, with a group of high-fashion 3d male silhouettes in sharp suits, their faces in deep shadow, gathered in a minimalist modern office illuminated by the vibrant blue, green, red, and orange glow of the microsoft logo on a sleek wall behind them.
(brilliant people) - each silhouette is posed with confidence, one looking at a glowing tablet, another pointing towards a holographic chart showing an upward trend.

(azure’s growth) - recreate the legendary image of steve jobs introducing the iphone in 2007, but the lone, high-fashion 3d male silhouette stands on a vast, dark stage, dramatically lit from below by an intense azure-blue light.
(mind-blowing consistently) - behind the silhouette, a colossal screen displays not a phone, but a mind-bending, abstract data visualization of the azure cloud, with the number "+50%" glowing brightly and repeatedly.

(most valuable) - again, recreate the steve jobs keynote stage, but this time the high-fashion 3d silhouette raises a gloved hand as the screen behind him flashes "most valuable company" above a shimmering apple logo that is being eclipsed by the four-colored microsoft logo.
(trillion dollar) - the stage is showered in a waterfall of digital light particles in microsoft's brand colors, and the number "$1,000,000,000,000" materializes in the air in front of the figure.

(brutal facts) - a recreation of the paypal mafia photo, but this time it's a tighter shot focusing on a central 3d silhouette at a glass table, his gloved hands steepled, intensely studying a holographic projection of complex, difficult-looking data charts glowing in a deep, serious blue.
(long-term bets) - other shadowed silhouettes around the table look on, the room's lighting a stark contrast of deep shadows and the strategic green and blue glow from the holographic interface.
