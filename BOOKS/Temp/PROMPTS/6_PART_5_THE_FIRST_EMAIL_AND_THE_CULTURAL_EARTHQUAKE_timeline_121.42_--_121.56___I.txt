**121.42 --> 122.22 : "I answered that..."**
- **Visual:** Medium close-up shot of Satya Nadella in a studio setting. He is looking slightly off-camera, his expression is deeply reflective and serious, as if recalling a difficult memory. The lighting is soft and focused on him.

**122.22 --> 122.72 : "...question..."**
- **Visual:** Quick flashback. A wide shot of a large, packed auditorium (like the Grace Hopper Celebration). We see the back of Satya Nadella on a brightly lit stage. A hand holding a microphone is visible in the foreground, slightly out of focus. The ambient sound of a crowd murmuring is heard.

**122.72 --> 123.46 : "...completely..."**
- **Visual:** Cut to a tight shot on Satya's face from the flashback event. The stage lights create a harsh glare. He has a slightly uncertain look as he speaks into the microphone. A subtle, slow zoom-in begins, heightening the tension of the moment.

**123.46 --> 124.26 : "...incorrectly."**
- **Visual:** Hard cut back to the present-day Satya Nadella. He makes direct eye contact with the camera, his face filled with frank admission and humility. He gives a slight, slow shake of his head, emphasizing the gravity of the error. The shot holds on his somber expression.
