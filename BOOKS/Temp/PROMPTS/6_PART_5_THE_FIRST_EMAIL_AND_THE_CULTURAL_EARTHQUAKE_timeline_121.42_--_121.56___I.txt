1. (0.00 - 1.30) - A 3D/2D parallax scene. A male silhouette is shown from the chest up, standing under a single spotlight against a dark background. He has a neutral, slightly forward-leaning posture as if listening intently. A large, glowing question mark icon materializes in front of him, creating depth between the layers.
2. (1.30 - 2.84) - A 3D/2D parallax scene. The male silhouette's posture changes; his head bows down in a moment of realization or regret. Simultaneously, the question mark icon in front of him shatters into small, glowing fragments that slowly drift away. A large, bold red "X" is stamped over the background, its layers moving separately to enhance the parallax effect.
