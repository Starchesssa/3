1. (0.00 - 9.64) - A central male silhouette shakes hands with three other silhouettes representing SAP, Oracle, and Red Hat. In the background, a ghostly, angry silhouette fades away, pointing at the word "LINUX" stylized to look like a cancerous cell.

2. (10.28 - 15.90) - A 3D parallax view inside a male silhouette's head. On a deeper layer, a stone crown labeled "EGO" is crumbling into dust. On a layer closer to the viewer, golden, interlocking gears labeled "PRAGMATISM" begin to turn smoothly.

3. (16.24 - 22.44) - Two male silhouettes, initially poised to fight, are gently turned by a central silhouette to face each other and shake hands. In the foreground, a large group of smaller customer silhouettes is in focus, watching approvingly.

4. (23.12 - 27.96) - A male silhouette looks into a mirror. The silhouette is bright and defined, while its reflection is a dark, aggressive, and unrecognizable older version of itself, which begins to crack and fade.

5. (28.38 - 32.54) - A dynamic scene transition. On the left, a large, intimidating silhouette towers over a much smaller one (the "bully"). As the scene pans to the right, the perspective shifts, and the two silhouettes become equals, standing side-by-side as partners.

6. (32.98 - 38.66) - A mature, calm male silhouette holds up a large, clear magnifying glass. The glass is focused on a group of customer silhouettes, making them the crisp, central point of the image while everything else is slightly blurred, signifying a singular focus.

7. (39.20 - 46.96) - A split-screen image with a 3D parallax effect. On the left, two silhouettes aggressively fight over a tiny, cracked, and shrinking pie in a dark setting. On the right, multiple silhouettes stand together in a bright, growing environment, each holding a slice from a massive, glowing pie.
