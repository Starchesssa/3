**48.86 - 53.50:** Cinematic, symbolic shot of two figures in 2010s-era business suits, shackled together at the wrist, sinking slowly in dark, murky water. One figure has a subtle Microsoft logo on their tie clip, the other a Nokia logo. They are not struggling, but resigned, as if hoping for a magical rescue that isn't coming.

**55.74 - 58.70:** A tense corporate boardroom, split down the middle by dramatic, moody lighting. On one side, executives are in light, arguing passionately for a deal. On the other side, executives are cast in deep shadow, their faces showing clear opposition and concern.

**59.16 - 61.84:** A tight, over-the-shoulder shot focusing on a character representing Bill Gates in a meeting. His expression is one of deep skepticism and disapproval as he listens to a presentation about the Nokia deal.

**62.28 - 66.20:** In a modern boardroom, a character representing Satya Nadella, his background subtly hinting at cloud computing with faint server rack visuals, decisively raises his hand in a "no" vote. He is the clear point of focus, separate from the group.

**68.72 - 72.76:** A powerful metaphorical image: A hand is throwing massive stacks of burning US dollars, embossed with the Microsoft logo, into a dark, bottomless trench labeled "The Mobile War."

**73.62 - 81.56:** A stylized depiction of a battlefield trench. A single, tiny soldier wearing a helmet with the Windows logo looks up in despair at two colossal, robotic giants representing Apple and Google, who loom over the entire landscape, their dominance absolute.

**82.54 - 94.28:** Abstract, dynamic visual of two forces colliding head-on. One force is made of flowing, glowing blue lines of software code ("Microsoft"). The other is made of solid, meticulously crafted Finnish hardware components ("Nokia"). The collision creates a violent explosion of sparks and fractured pieces.

**96.72 - 101.20:** A chaotic, dysfunctional open-plan office. On one side, Microsoft-branded whiteboards are filled with delayed project timelines. On the other, Nokia-branded hardware prototypes are left disassembled. In the middle, two groups of employees are in a heated argument, while a central manager's chair sits empty and spinning slowly.

**102.04 - 107.28:** A massive, ornate bank vault door stands wide open. The plaque on the door reads "$7.2 Billion." The interior of the vault is completely empty, save for a single cobweb and a layer of dust on the floor.

**107.86 - 111.84:** A simple, stark line graph on a screen. The title reads "Windows Phone Market Share." A single, glowing red line starts at a low point and then plummets sharply downwards off the bottom of the chart.

**112.88 - 117.70:** A grim, sci-fi scene in a dark laboratory. A "zombie" mobile phone with a cracked, flickering Windows screen is propped up on a stand. Mechanical arms are continuously feeding it stacks of cash, which turn to ash as soon as they touch the device.

**122.50 - 129.42:** A wide, hellish shot of an immense industrial furnace roaring with fire. A line of exhausted executives in soot-stained suits are mindlessly shoveling wheelbarrows full of cash into the flames, illustrating the sunk cost fallacy.

**130.46 - 138.16:** A dramatic, epic final scene. A figure representing CEO Steve Ballmer stands alone on the bridge of a massive, sinking corporate ship named "M.S. NOKIA." The ship isn't taking on water, but is visibly bleeding money from its hull, and the company flag is tattered.
