1. (0.00 - 7.88) - A 2D parallax image showing two male silhouettes sinking in dark, murky water. They are bound together at the wrists by a heavy metal shackle. One silhouette has "OS" glowing faintly on its chest, and the other has "Hardware". They are looking up toward the water's surface, hoping to float.

2. (7.88 - 16.22) - A long, dark boardroom. A single silhouette stands at the head of the table, gesturing emphatically. The other silhouettes seated around the table are in opposition; one has his head in his hands, another is turned away, and a prominent silhouette representing Bill Gates has his arms crossed, shaking his head "no".

3. (16.22 - 20.58) - A side profile of a male silhouette, representing Satya Nadella, standing against a background of glowing blue cloud server racks. He is holding his hand up in a firm, clear "stop" gesture.

4. (20.58 - 27.14) - A silhouette stands at the edge of a deep, dark canyon labeled "The Mobile War". He is throwing armfuls of glowing dollar bills into the abyss, where they disintegrate into dust before hitting the bottom, symbolizing billions being thrown into a lost cause.

5. (27.14 - 35.94) - An image from inside a muddy trench. Two small silhouettes look up fearfully at two massive, towering monoliths that loom over them, one with a stylized apple logo and the other with a "G". In the background, a crowd of consumer silhouettes is seen walking away, turning their backs on the trench.

6. (35.94 - 48.66) - A dynamic and chaotic scene of a head-on collision. A fluid, glowing blue entity made of binary code (representing Microsoft's software culture) crashes violently into a solid, metallic entity made of gears and circuits (representing Nokia's hardware culture). Sparks and debris fly at the point of impact.

7. (48.66 - 55.58) - A messy office scene showing total confusion. Silhouettes are arguing in the background. In the foreground, a calendar on the wall has multiple dates crossed out with red "DELAYED" stamps. A central silhouette sits at a desk under a giant, glowing question mark, signifying a lack of leadership.

8. (55.58 - 61.66) - A giant, imposing bank vault door with "$7.2 Billion" engraved on it swings open. A single silhouette stands before it, looking into the darkness. A beam of light reveals the vault is completely empty except for a few dust motes, symbolizing zero return on investment.

9. (61.66 - 72.08) - A dual-panel image. On the left, a large screen displays a line graph for "Market Share" that plummets downwards into the negative. On the right, a silhouette is desperately feeding stacks of cash to a shambling, zombie-like figure whose head is an old mobile phone.

10. (72.08 - 83.80) - A silhouette stands next to a massive, roaring furnace. He is using a shovel to continuously scoop cash from a huge pile he is standing on and toss it into the flames, unable to admit failure and stop feeding the fire.

11. (83.80 - 93.54) - A lone silhouette, representing CEO Steve Ballmer, stands on a high, crumbling pedestal. Below him, a giant corporate logo is cracked and appears to be bleeding money, which pools at the bottom of the frame. The entire scene has a dark, defeated atmosphere.
