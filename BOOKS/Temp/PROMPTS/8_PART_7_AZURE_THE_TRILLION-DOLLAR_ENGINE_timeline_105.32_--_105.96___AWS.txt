1. (0.00 - 8.41) - A confident 3D male silhouette stands before a vast, abstract cityscape representing large corporations. Glowing lines of light, like a neural network, connect the silhouette to each building in the city, symbolizing "decades of relationships." The scene has a deep 2D parallax effect.
2. (8.42 - 13.37) - A 2D parallax grid of abstract, geometric company logos fills the screen. A wave of light emanates from a central point, illuminating each logo one by one, visually representing that every company "ran on Microsoft software."
3. (13.38 - 19.59) - A male silhouette stands at the head of a long boardroom table, addressing other seated silhouettes. Between the presenter and the audience, holographic 3D icons of a server rack and an email symbol float and glow steadily, symbolizing established "trust."
4. (19.60 - 24.09) - Two male silhouettes in the foreground complete a deal with a firm, glowing handshake. In the 3D parallax background, a detailed silhouette of a factory and office complex is lifted and absorbed into a large, luminous, abstract cloud shape.
5. (24.10 - 34.56) - A male silhouette gestures towards a massive screen displaying a dynamic line graph. The line shoots upwards at a near-vertical "insane" angle, with the glowing numbers "90%" and "100%" flashing alongside it. The background uses a 2D parallax effect with faded, repeating graphs to emphasize "multiple years in a row."
