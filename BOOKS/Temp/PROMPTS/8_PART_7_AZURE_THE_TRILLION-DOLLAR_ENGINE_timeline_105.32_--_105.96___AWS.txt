**105.32 - 108.76:** A vast, imposing mountain peak labeled "AWS" dominates the landscape, casting a long shadow. In the foreground, a smaller, but solid and well-built structure labeled "Microsoft" stands, with deep, strong roots visible, labeled "Enterprise Relationships".

**109.38 - 113.06:** A stylized animation of a world map. A central Microsoft logo has glowing, established energy lines connecting it to hundreds of skyscraper icons representing the world's biggest companies. The lines look like a solid, decades-old network.

**113.74 - 118.20:** A split screen. On one side, a server room with racks of servers all displaying the Windows Server logo. On the other side, a busy corporate office where every computer screen shows Microsoft Office applications.

**118.70 - 124.42:** A close-up shot of a handshake between a Microsoft representative and a CEO in a boardroom. The camera pulls back to show the boardroom window, which looks out onto a physical server farm on the company's campus.

**124.92 - 128.64:** The scene transitions. The physical server farm outside the window dissolves and transforms into a vast, powerful, and efficient digital cloud in the sky, glowing with the blue Azure logo. The executives in the boardroom nod in agreement.

**129.42 - 132.14:** An animated, futuristic line graph. A line representing "Azure" shoots upwards at a nearly vertical, explosive trajectory.

**132.64 - 138.98:** The line graph continues its dramatic ascent, with glowing labels appearing next to it at intervals: "+90%", "+100%", "+95%". The line repeats this meteoric rise over multiple sections of the graph labeled "Year 1", "Year 2", "Year 3".
