**[0:27-0:35]** A colossal, glowing mountain with the AWS logo on its peak, dominating a vast digital landscape. It represents a massive head start, an almost insurmountable challenge. Below, the landscape is just beginning to form, symbolizing the nascent cloud market. Cinematic, epic scale, hyper-realistic.

**[0:35-0:43]** Inside a vast, polished Microsoft corporate hall, two giant, monolithic pillars labeled "Windows" and "Office" tower over everything. In a forgotten, dusty corner, a tiny, fragile blue sapling labeled "Azure" sprouts from the floor, almost completely ignored. It's seen as a tiny side project, a distraction. Symbolic, dramatic lighting.

**[0:44-0:46]** A close-up shot of one man, Satya Nadella, turning away from the monolithic "Windows" and "Office" pillars. His gaze is fixed on the small, glowing "Azure" sapling in the corner. A look of focus and vision is on his face, illuminated by the sapling's soft blue light, seeing potential where others saw a distraction. Cinematic, shallow depth of field, hopeful.
