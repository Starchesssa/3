1. (0.00 - 7.50) - A vast, 3D parallax digital landscape representing a race track made of glowing circuits. Far in the distance, a lone male silhouette plants a flag with a luminous "AWS" logo on the finish line. The starting blocks in the foreground are all empty, visually representing a massive, uncontested head start.

2. (7.50 - 16.00) - A 2D parallax shot inside a sleek, dark Microsoft boardroom. A group of male silhouettes are huddled around a large, central holographic table, mesmerized by the brightly glowing 3D logos of "Windows" and "Office". In a distant, shadowy corner, a tiny, faint blue light labeled "Azure" pulses weakly, completely unnoticed. One silhouette makes a dismissive hand gesture towards the corner, signifying it as a distraction.

3. (16.00 - 19.00) - The scene shifts to focus on a single male silhouette standing apart from the main group. He has turned his back on the bright central table and is looking intently across the dark room at the small, ignored "Azure" light. A soft spotlight illuminates this solitary silhouette, highlighting his different perspective and vision.
