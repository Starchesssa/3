1. (0.00 - 14.26) - A wide, documentary-style shot of a massive, sterile tech campus building. In the deep foreground, a single male silhouette stands small, looking up at the imposing glass and steel structure. In the background, visible through the glass walls, other silhouettes move slowly and without clear purpose. A subtle, toxic-green haze hangs in the distant hallways. The parallax effect makes the foreground silhouette feel stationary while the background building shifts, emphasizing the scale and sickness of the company.

2. (14.78 - 23.18) - A starkly lit meeting room. In the foreground, a male silhouette of a manager gestures towards a large presentation screen. The screen displays a diagram of a bell curve with smaller human silhouettes being forced into rigid categories. The diagram is glitching with red error lines. The parallax effect shows the screen and foreground manager are close to the camera, while the silhouettes of employees sitting at the table in the background shift slightly, their postures tense and uneasy.

3. (23.74 - 32.34) - A male manager silhouette is shown sitting alone in his glass-walled office late at night, the empty open-plan office dark behind him. The camera is focused on his desk in the foreground. On his glowing monitor is a spreadsheet of his team members next to a rigid bell curve graph. The parallax effect creates depth, with the desk and monitor in sharp focus while the empty office in the background seems to drift, highlighting the manager's isolation and the pressure he is under.

4. (32.66 - 42.26) - A conceptual image showing a large, disembodied silhouette hand meticulously sorting smaller employee silhouettes into three glowing, designated zones. The zones are labeled with abstract symbols: a bright star for "top," a neutral circle for "average," and a damning red 'X' for "poor." The parallax effect focuses on the hand and the silhouettes in the foreground, while a cold, digital grid pattern in the background slides by slowly.

5. (42.94 - 50.48) - A line of male silhouettes stands in a sterile, white corporate hallway that stretches into the distance. In the foreground, a portion of a clipboard is visible. One silhouette in the line is glowing with a faint red outline and beginning to digitally pixelate and fade away, as if being erased. The parallax effect makes the foreground clipboard feel static, while the line of figures and the long hallway behind them shift, creating a sense of inevitable doom.

6. (51.04 - 65.88) - A manager silhouette stands in his office, looking through the glass wall at his team of five high-performing silhouettes collaborating enthusiastically around a whiteboard in the background. In the foreground, the manager's reflection on the glass is distorted, and it shows him being forced to place a red "failure" stamp over one of the superstar figures. The parallax effect keeps the manager's conflicted reflection in the foreground sharp, while the oblivious, successful team in the background moves slightly.

7. (66.40 - 73.36) - A dramatic, shadowy scene focusing on two silhouettes. In the foreground, a manager silhouette places a hand on the shoulder of a team member silhouette. However, the manager's shadow cast on the wall behind them is long and distorted, showing him holding a sharp, geometric shape resembling a dagger behind the other's back. The parallax effect makes the shadows on the background wall seem to writhe and shift independently of the figures in the midground.

8. (74.16 - 82.02) - An overhead, stylized view of an office floor plan designed like a gladiator's arena or a maze. Male silhouettes occupy individual cubicles, but instead of working, their posture is defensive. They are shown warily watching each other. Faint red lines, like laser sights, connect some of the figures. Using a parallax effect, foreground architectural pillars slide past the frame, giving the viewer the sense of spying on this tense, toxic environment.

9. (82.56 - 90.34) - A close-up shot on two office desks side-by-side. In the foreground, one male silhouette leans over, clearly asking for help. In the midground, the colleague silhouette deliberately turns away, putting on headphones and staring intently at his screen. A shimmering, semi-transparent wall of light materializes between them, symbolizing the barrier to collaboration. The parallax effect causes the background of the blurred office to move, isolating the two figures in their zero-sum conflict.

10. (90.84 - 95.78) - In a dark server room, a silhouette is seen in the foreground, discreetly unplugging a network cable from a server rack. In the background, visible on a small monitor, is a live feed of another silhouette in a bright conference room giving a presentation that suddenly freezes and glitches out, causing confusion. The parallax effect makes the foreground hand and cable feel immediate and sinister, while the background scene on the monitor appears distant.

11. (96.56 - 105.16) - A corporate boardroom meeting. The camera is low, looking across the table. In the foreground are documents and a pen. In the midground, one male silhouette is pointing an accusatory finger across the table at another, who recoils. A third silhouette subtly slides a report representing "credit" toward himself. The focus is on the tense, political body language. The parallax effect shows the city skyline through the large background window moving slowly, contrasting the corporate infighting with the outside world.

12. (105.80 - 118.72) - A powerful, abstract shot of a large, complex corporate machine made of gears and circuits. In the center, a single gear, glowing an angry red and labeled "STACK RANKING," is shown grinding against the others, throwing sparks and causing the surrounding mechanisms to crack and break down. Silhouettes of engineers frantically try to patch up the damage. The parallax effect shows sparks flying in the foreground while the massive, destructive machine operates in the background.

13. (119.30 - 132.76) - A final, haunting image of a brilliant engineer silhouette standing in a hall of mirrors. In the foreground, his hand is raised, holding a political, featureless mask, as if he is about to put it on. His reflection, and the reflections of other silhouettes in the background mirrors, are distorted, paranoid, and looking over their shoulders. The parallax effect makes the reflections in the background mirrors warp and shift as the camera moves, representing the loss of identity and trust.
