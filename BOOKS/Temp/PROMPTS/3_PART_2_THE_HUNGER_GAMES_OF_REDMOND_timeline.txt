1.  (0.00 - 4.78) - A massive, brutalist-style corporate building at dusk, half-shrouded in a sickly yellow fog. Parallax effect shows clouds moving slowly behind the building.

2.  (5.58 - 14.26) - A 3D male silhouette stands inside a giant glass cube that is slowly cracking. Yellow light emanates from the cracks. Parallax effect makes the dark, abstract office background shift slightly.

3.  (14.78 - 20.76) - A 3D manager silhouette faces a large screen displaying a glowing bell curve. The words "STACK RANKING" are projected in harsh yellow light on the wall behind him. Parallax effect makes the data points on the curve seem to float.

4.  (21.62 - 29.72) - A stressed 3D manager silhouette at a desk, physically pushing one of five smaller silhouettes on his desk into a dimly lit "low performer" section of a curve. A single desk lamp casts a harsh yellow glow.

5.  (30.32 - 42.26) - Close-up on a 3D silhouette's hand stamping a file with a large, glowing red down-arrow. The entire scene is lit by the ominous yellow glow of a nearby monitor.

6.  (42.94 - 50.48) - A single 3D male silhouette stands on a trapdoor in a vast, empty office space, illuminated by a single yellow spotlight from above. Parallax effect makes the dark walls of the office seem to recede.

7.  (51.04 - 65.88) - A 3D manager silhouette in a team of five identical silhouettes, agonizingly holding a single red tag. The scene is filled with a thick yellow fog, obscuring the background.

8.  (66.40 - 71.78) - A stylized shot of one 3D silhouette standing with its back to the camera as another silhouette behind it prepares to "stab" it with a glowing yellow, abstract dagger.

9.  (72.32 - 79.72) - Multiple 3D silhouettes stand on separate, towering pillars in a dark, arena-like space, warily watching each other under a single, harsh yellow light from above.

10. (79.72 - 87.72) - Two 3D silhouettes sit at desks placed back-to-back, completely isolated from each other by a shimmering curtain of falling yellow data code between them.

11. (88.36 - 95.78) - A 3D silhouette secretly unplugs a cable from a server rack, causing its lights to flicker and die out. A harsh yellow emergency light illuminates the scene.

12. (96.56 - 105.16) - 3D silhouettes around a polished boardroom table are not looking at each other, but are instead moving chess pieces around. A single yellow light hangs low over the chessboard table.

13. (105.80 - 118.72) - An intricate, glowing blueprint of a futuristic device is being slowly erased by a wave of yellow digital static. A single 3D silhouette watches helplessly.

14. (119.30 - 132.76) - A 3D engineer silhouette sits at a desk. His shadow, cast on the wall by a yellow light, is a different, more menacing silhouette of a politician. The shadow moves independently with a parallax effect.
