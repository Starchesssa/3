1. (0.00 - 11.32) - A 3D character with an angular head looking up in confusion at a giant, glitching corporate monolith that looms over a rain-slicked neon city, all in parallax.
2. (11.78 - 20.76) - A 3D character recoiling in horror, hands raised defensively, from a glowing, menacing holographic diagram labeled "STACK RANKING" that dominates a dark room, all in parallax.
3. (21.62 - 32.34) - A 3D manager character hunched over a holographic terminal, physically trapped and compressed by a glowing bell curve of light that surrounds them, all in parallax.
4. (32.66 - 42.26) - A 3D manager character with a posture of extreme reluctance, forced to point a single, trembling finger at one of their team members who is then illuminated by a damning red spotlight, all in parallax.
5. (42.94 - 50.48) - A 3D character frantically running down a dark, geometric corridor, a glowing red target locked onto their back as abstract digital shadows close in from behind, all in parallax.
6. (51.04 - 65.88) - A 3D manager character standing in anguish, head in their hands, surrounded by five brilliantly glowing superstar figures who are unaware of the manager's pained dilemma, all in parallax.
7. (66.40 - 73.36) - A 3D character in a dynamic pose, stabbing a glowing geometric data-knife into the back of an unsuspecting colleague working at a neon terminal, all in parallax.
8. (74.16 - 82.02) - Five 3D characters in a dark, circular room, standing with their backs to each other, postures tense and isolated, as if in a standoff before a duel, all in parallax.
9. (82.56 - 90.34) - Two 3D characters facing off, one character stands triumphantly over a fallen rival who is dissolving into pixels, signifying a zero-sum outcome in a sterile corporate environment, all in parallax.
10. (90.84 - 95.78) - A 3D character crouched low in the shadows, maliciously unplugging a critical glowing cable from a server rack, causing sparks and digital decay to spread across the system, all in parallax.
11. (96.56 - 105.16) - A 3D character at a boardroom table pointing an accusatory finger, their body language aggressive, while another character shrinks back in their chair, taking the blame, all in parallax.
12. (105.80 - 115.92) - An authoritative 3D character standing before a giant, cracked viewscreen displaying a crumbling corporate flowchart, their pose one of final judgment on the destructive system, all in parallax.
13. (116.56 - 123.92) - Several 3D characters entangled in glowing red tape, their poses showing them fighting each other instead of working on a complex, beautiful holographic blueprint floating above them, all in parallax.
14. (124.38 - 132.76) - A 3D character in mid-transformation, their brilliant engineer form decaying and glitching into a dark, sharp-suited politician, their posture twisted in a paranoid grimace, all in parallax.
