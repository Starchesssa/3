1. (0.00 - 11.32) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a young tech worker with an abstract angular head, wearing a hoodie, looking up in confusion at a giant, monolithic corporate building that looms over him. In the dark sky behind the building, the words "TOXIC SYSTEM" glow with a faint, glitchy light in a parallax background.

2. (11.78 - 20.76) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a manager in a sharp suit with an abstract angular head, grimacing as he holds a house of cards that is about to collapse. On the top card are the words "STACK RANKING". The scene is a minimalist, dark office with a deep parallax effect separating the manager from the collapsing cards.

3. (21.62 - 29.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a manager with an abstract angular head, posed stiffly like a puppet with strings leading up out of frame, being forced to grade employee silhouettes on a giant, glowing bell curve projected on the wall behind him in a deep parallax environment.

4. (30.32 - 42.26) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a manager on one knee, head bowed in despair, forced to place a red "POOR PERFORMER" label on one of five identical, glowing high-performing employee silhouettes standing in a line before him in a dark, abstract space.

5. (42.94 - 50.48) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of an employee with an abstract angular head, shoulders slumped in defeat, walking down a long, dark corporate hallway. A red target symbol is projected onto their back, and the only other light source is the open, dark doorway at the very end of the hall, creating a long parallax effect.

6. (51.04 - 65.88) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a manager in a suit, covering his abstract face with his hands in an anguished pose. He is surrounded by five brilliantly shining silhouettes representing his "superstar" team. In the background, the abstract corporate logo glows menacingly in parallax.

7. (66.40 - 76.90) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D manager silhouette with an abstract angular head, reluctantly stabbing an employee silhouette in the back. The scene is an office where the walls appear to be dripping with a green, toxic substance, with the word "BRUTAL" in a stark, bold font on the back wall.

8. (77.42 - 87.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of two 3D employee silhouettes with abstract angular heads, sitting back-to-back in an office, suspiciously glancing over their shoulders at each other. The cubicle walls are exaggeratedly high, creating a maze-like environment. In the background, the words "HUNGER GAMES" are visible in a bold, cinematic font.

9. (88.36 - 95.78) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a professional in a dress shirt, posed to be sneakily pulling a glowing power cord from a colleague's workstation, a triumphant look suggested by their posture. In the background, the words "ZERO SUM" are subtly integrated into a digital code pattern on the wall in parallax.

10. (96.56 - 105.16) - a geometric vector illustration style of several 3D silhouettes in suits around a boardroom table that resembles a chessboard. One figure stands, pointing an accusatory finger at another who shrinks back in their chair. The poses are all about political maneuvering, with the words "BLAME" and "CREDIT" projected on the back wall.

11. (105.80 - 118.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of an innovator with an abstract angular head, on their knees, being crushed by a giant, falling block with an abstract corporate logo. The innovator's pose is one of struggle, trying to protect a small, glowing light of creativity. In the background, the word "INNOVATION" is shattering like glass.

12. (119.30 - 132.76) - a geometric vector illustration style of a line of 3D silhouettes. The first in line is a brilliant engineer, standing tall, but the figures progressively become more hunched and paranoid, turning into backstabbing politicians holding daggers. A dark, cancerous geometric pattern creeps across the floor towards them in a parallax layer, with the word "PARANOID" flickering in the background.
