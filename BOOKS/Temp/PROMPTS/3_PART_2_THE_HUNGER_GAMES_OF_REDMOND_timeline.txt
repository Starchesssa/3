1.  (0.00 - 11.32) - a geometric vector illustration style of a lone character silhouette with an angular, featureless head, recoiling in horror from a giant, abstract corporate monolith that is glowing with a toxic green light and cracking apart, all in parallax.
2.  (11.32 - 14.26) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character silhouette with an angular, featureless head, bracing for impact as the abstract geometric world around them violently implodes into a central point, sending sharp shards flying, all in parallax.
3.  (14.26 - 20.76) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character silhouette with an angular, featureless head, crushed and struggling beneath a teetering stack of heavy, sharp-edged blocks that represent a ranking system, all in a minimalist, oppressive environment in parallax.
4.  (20.76 - 29.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of a manager silhouette with an angular, featureless head, standing reluctantly over a line of smaller silhouettes while being forced by abstract puppet strings from above to draw a harsh, glowing bell-curve over them, all in parallax.
5.  (29.72 - 42.26) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character silhouette with an angular, featureless head, being forcefully pushed by an unseen force into a dark, shadowy pit, separating them from other silhouettes who stand on higher, brighter platforms, all in parallax.
6.  (42.26 - 50.48) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character silhouette with an angular, featureless head, marked with a glowing red 'X', falling backwards through a square hole in the floor into complete darkness as other silhouettes watch from the edge, all in parallax.
7.  (50.48 - 65.88) - a geometric vector illustration style of a manager silhouette with an angular, featureless head, holding their head in anguish while a dark, sharp-edged shadow extends from their body to point at one of five brightly glowing silhouettes surrounding them, all in parallax.
8.  (65.88 - 73.36) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character silhouette with an angular, featureless head, plunging a glowing, shard-like dagger into the back of another unsuspecting silhouette, whose body arcs in shock in a dark, oppressive corridor, all in parallax.
9.  (73.36 - 82.02) - a geometric vector illustration style of several character silhouettes with angular, featureless heads, standing defensively back-to-back in a circular, arena-like space, each glancing suspiciously at the shadows and refusing to cooperate, all in parallax.
10. (82.02 - 90.34) - a geometric vector illustration style of two silhouettes at adjacent angular desks, one turning their back to pull a lever that causes the other’s desk to sink into the floor, a pose of ruthless competition in a stark environment, all in parallax.
11. (90.34 - 95.78) - a geometric vector illustration style of a silhouette with an angular, featureless head, crouched in the shadows and maliciously cutting a glowing wire on another person's complex project, their pose sneaky and destructive, all in parallax.
12. (95.78 - 105.16) - a geometric vector illustration style of silhouettes in a boardroom, where one character stands on the table, grabbing a glowing orb of "credit" while pointing an accusatory finger at another character who is engulfed by a dark shadow of "blame", all in parallax.
13. (105.16 - 118.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of a powerful silhouette with an angular, featureless head, swinging a massive, heavy hammer to shatter a complex, glowing gear-work machine representing innovation, sending sharp fragments flying, all in parallax.
14. (118.72 - 123.92) - a geometric vector illustration style of two silhouettes trying to build a geometric tower, but each has a hand behind their back holding a dagger, their poses tense and full of mistrust as the structure between them remains unstable, all in parallax.
15. (123.92 - 132.76) - a geometric vector illustration style of a bright, upright silhouette being corrupted by dark, angular, vine-like tendrils, its posture twisting from creative to a hunched, paranoid stance, symbolizing the decay of talent, all in parallax.
