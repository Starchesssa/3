1.  (0.00 - 5.58) - **Image Description:** A shot through a rain-streaked window looking out at a colossal, brutalist-style corporate campus at dusk. The building is a single, monolithic block of concrete and dark glass, looking impossibly heavy and slow.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** The raindrops on the window pane are in the foreground, the massive building is in the midground, and the gloomy, overcast sky is in the background. As the camera pans slightly, the building seems to shift slowly against the sky.

2.  (5.58 - 14.78) - **Image Description:** A low-angle shot of the base of the same corporate building. A large, jagged crack runs up a concrete support pillar, from which a sickly, toxic green light emanates and pulses faintly.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** A piece of cracked concrete is close in the foreground. The pillar with the glowing crack is in the midground, and the rest of the building's imposing facade stretches up into the dark background.

3.  (14.78 - 21.62) - **Image Description:** A stylized organizational chart is shown against a dark, digital grid. Instead of a stable pyramid, the boxes containing 2D silhouettes are stacked like a precarious Jenga tower, wobbling dangerously. The words "STACK RANKING" in a bold, glitching font are superimposed over the image.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** The "STACK RANKING" text is in the foreground. The teetering tower of silhouettes is in the midground. The digital grid recedes into the background.

4.  (21.62 - 30.32) - **Image Description:** A manager silhouette stands before a line of their employee silhouettes. A giant, translucent bell curve is projected over all of them. Unseen forces are physically pushing and sorting the employee silhouettes into fixed positions along the curve: a few at the top, most in the middle, and a few at the bottom.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** The glowing lines of the bell curve graphic are in the foreground. The manager and employees being sorted are in the midground. A sterile, white corporate background is far behind them.

5.  (30.32 - 42.94) - **Image Description:** A line of identical, high-performing 3D silhouettes stand perfectly straight. A giant, mechanical arm descends from above and violently stamps one of the silhouettes on the chest with a glowing red label that reads "POOR PERFORMER."
    *   **Parallax Effect:** The red stamp graphic appears to be on the lens in the foreground. The mechanical arm and the line of silhouettes are in the midground. An endless, repeating pattern of office cubicles stretches into the background.

6.  (42.94 - 51.04) - **Image Description:** The silhouette stamped "POOR PERFORMER" is now standing alone in the middle of an office floor. Suddenly, a trapdoor opens beneath their feet, and they plummet into a dark abyss. Other silhouettes at surrounding desks don't look up from their work.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** The sharp edge of the trapdoor is in the foreground. The falling silhouette is in the midground. The office environment and the indifferent silhouettes are in the background.

7.  (51.04 - 66.40) - **Image Description:** A manager silhouette stands in a dark boardroom, facing five glowing, golden "superstar" silhouettes. The manager's hands are trembling as they hold a single, blood-red tag with the word "FAILURE" on it, forced to choose which superstar to label.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** The manager's hand holding the tag is sharply in focus in the foreground. The five glowing silhouettes stand unaware in the midground. The dark, imposing boardroom table and chairs are in the background.

8.  (66.40 - 72.32) - **Image Description:** A close-up on the manager silhouette's hand. He is now placing a stylized, translucent dagger onto the back of one of the golden silhouettes. The moment the dagger touches, the golden glow of the victim begins to flicker and dim.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** The shimmering digital dagger is in the foreground. The silhouettes of the manager and the victim are in the midground. The other four "superstar" silhouettes watch from the background, their own glows slightly diminished.

9.  (72.32 - 80.90) - **Image Description:** A wide shot of an office re-imagined as a gladiatorial arena. Dozens of silhouettes are scattered throughout, standing by their desks but warily eyeing each other instead of working. No one is collaborating. In the center, a corporate logo flickers on a pedestal.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** A cubicle wall acts as a frame in the foreground. The silhouettes in the "arena" are in the midground. A massive screen displaying fluctuating performance charts glows on the far wall in the background.

10. (80.90 - 88.36) - **Image Description:** Two silhouettes sit at adjacent desks. One turns to the other, offering a helping hand. The second silhouette recoils, pulling their work closer and shielding it with their body. A glowing red, downward-pointing arrow appears above the head of the silhouette who offered help.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** The corner of a computer monitor is in the foreground. The two interacting silhouettes are in the midground. The rest of the office, filled with other isolated silhouettes, is in the background.

11. (88.36 - 96.56) - **Image Description:** From a low angle, one silhouette secretly reaches under a desk and unplugs a power cord. In the background, the screen of a neighboring colleague silhouette instantly goes black, their posture slumping in defeat. The saboteur silhouette leans back with a faint, triumphant glow.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** The power cord being pulled from the socket is in the extreme foreground. The saboteur silhouette is in the midground. The victim silhouette and their now-dark workstation are in the background.

12. (96.56 - 105.80) - **Image Description:** Silhouettes are seated around a polished boardroom table. One silhouette points to a complex diagram on a screen, but another silhouette subtly slides a name placard with their own name in front of the first person's, stealing the credit. Simultaneously, they use a long pointer to push a puck labeled "BLAME" toward an unsuspecting third silhouette.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** The "BLAME" puck sliding across the reflective table is in the foreground. The silhouettes maneuvering for position are in the midground. The bright screen with the diagram is in the background.

13. (105.80 - 119.30) - **Image Description:** A single silhouette walks through a vast, dark field littered with thousands of shattered lightbulbs—a graveyard of dead ideas. In the far distance, the monolithic corporate building looms, casting a long, oppressive shadow over the entire scene.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** A large, cracked lightbulb with fizzling filaments is in the foreground. The lonely silhouette walks through the debris field in the midground. The corporate building and dark sky are in the far background.

14. (119.30 - 132.76) - **Image Description:** A slow zoom out reveals a brilliant engineer silhouette working intently at their desk. As the camera pulls back, we see their cubicle is part of a vast, dark labyrinth. Other silhouettes hide around corners, holding digital daggers. A dark, vein-like texture, like a spreading cancer, slowly grows over the entire scene.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** The translucent, corrupting "cancer" texture spreads across the screen in the foreground. The maze and the paranoid, armed silhouettes are in the midground. The single brilliant engineer, unaware of the danger, is in the background, growing smaller and smaller.
