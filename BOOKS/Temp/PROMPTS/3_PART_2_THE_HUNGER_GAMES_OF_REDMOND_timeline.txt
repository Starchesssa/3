1.  (0.00 - 11.32) - **Visual:** The camera slowly pans up a monolithic, impossibly tall glass skyscraper that represents the "giant tech company." In the foreground, thick, digital vines labeled "TOXIC SYSTEM" and "DESTRUCTIVE" are slowly wrapping around the building, constricting it. Inside, 3D male silhouettes are seen through the windows, moving in slow motion as if stuck in tar. The parallax effect is created as the camera's upward movement makes the foreground vines glide past quickly, while the distant clouds in the background move very slowly.

2.  (11.78 - 20.76) - **Visual:** A cut to a sterile, white, minimalist boardroom. A manager silhouette stands at the head of the table. The words "STACK RANKING" materialize in the air in front of him, constructed from menacing, sharp-edged, metallic letters. The words cast a long, dark shadow over the entire room. The camera orbits the manager and the floating text; the text in the foreground moves more than the manager in the midground, and the walls of the room in the background barely shift, creating a sense of depth and dread.

3.  (21.62 - 29.72) - **Visual:** A manager silhouette sits at a desk looking at a holographic display showing his team of five employee silhouettes. A glowing, oppressive bell curve graphic descends from the ceiling and forcibly reshapes the hologram, pushing the identical silhouettes into different positions along the curve against their will. The camera tracks sideways, parallel to the desk. The desk and manager in the foreground move quickly across the screen, while the holographic employees in the midground slide past slower, emphasizing the manager's forced perspective.

4.  (30.32 - 42.26) - **Visual:** A rapid-cut sequence. First, one silhouette is elevated on a bright green, glowing pedestal labeled "TOP PERFORMER." Second, three silhouettes stand on a flat, neutral grey platform. Third, the last silhouette is pushed by an unseen force onto a trapdoor illuminated by a single, harsh red light, with the words "POOR PERFORMER" projected on the floor around them. In this final shot, the camera is angled downwards; the edge of the trapdoor in the foreground is sharp, creating a parallax effect against the distant silhouette standing nervously in the center.

5.  (42.94 - 50.48) - **Visual:** The silhouette on the red-lit trapdoor looks up in fear. A huge, red, digital "X" is stamped over them, and the trapdoor immediately snaps open. They fall into a dark abyss. The camera follows them down for a moment; the square frame of the trapdoor (foreground) rushes up and past the camera, while the falling silhouette (midground) shrinks into the darkness.

6.  (51.04 - 65.88) - **Visual:** A manager silhouette stands before five of his team members, all of whom are glowing with a brilliant golden aura representing "superstars." A giant, mechanical, corporate arm descends from the ceiling and grabs the manager's wrist, forcing his hand to point at one of the golden silhouettes. The moment he points, that silhouette's golden aura flickers and extinguishes, replaced by a dull red. The camera is positioned over the manager's shoulder; his arm is in the foreground, while the five silhouettes stand in the midground, their relative positions shifting to create depth as the camera pushes in slightly.

7.  (66.40 - 73.36) - **Visual:** In a highly stylized, slow-motion shot, a manager silhouette stands behind a teammate. He holds a translucent, digital dagger. With a look of anguish, visible only in his posture, he stabs the teammate in the back. The victim doesn't bleed but dissolves into a cloud of 1s and 0s. The camera slowly orbits this action; the other team members in the background are blurred and drift slower than the two central figures, creating a dramatic parallax effect that isolates the act of betrayal.

8.  (74.16 - 82.02) - **Visual:** An overhead shot of a vast open-plan office. The walls retract into the floor, and circular arena-like barriers rise, isolating each desk. The silhouettes look up from their work, now gladiators in a corporate arena. Text on the screen flashes: "THE HUNGER GAMES OF REDMOND." The camera pushes down from the ceiling; the light fixtures in the foreground move past the frame quickly, revealing the transformed office arena below.

9.  (82.56 - 90.34) - **Visual:** Two silhouettes sit at desks placed on opposite ends of a giant seesaw. One silhouette completes a task, and a green "SUCCESS" icon appears above them, causing their end of the seesaw to rise high into the air. This simultaneously causes the other silhouette's end to crash violently into the floor, their screen flashing red with a "RANKED LOWER" message. The camera looks up from a low angle; the crashing desk in the foreground is large and impactful, while the rising figure in the background seems distant.

10. (90.84 - 95.78) - **Visual:** A silhouette is building an intricate tower out of glowing blocks of code. In the background, another silhouette watches, then deliberately types a command on their keyboard. This sends a "virus" that appears as a digital termite, which quickly eats away at the base of the first silhouette's tower, causing it to collapse into a pile of buggy, red code. The camera focuses on the collapsing tower in the midground, with the saboteur's keyboard in the near-foreground and the saboteur's own shadowy figure in the background, creating layers of action.

11. (96.56 - 105.16) - **Visual:** A meeting room where the conference table is a giant chessboard. The silhouettes aren't talking; they are sliding game pieces across the board. One piece is a glowing trophy labeled "CREDIT," another is a heavy, dark iron ball labeled "BLAME." One player skillfully slides the blame piece in front of an opponent while snatching a credit piece from the center of the board. The camera glides along the side of the table, making the foreground chess pieces appear to move faster than the focused silhouettes in the midground.

12. (105.80 - 118.72) - **Visual:** A single, authoritative silhouette stands in front of a giant screen displaying a timeline of the company's products. The quote "the most destructive process inside of Microsoft" appears beside him. As the narration says "crippled innovation for a decade," the product timeline on the screen glitches and corrodes, with a ten-year section turning to black static. The camera slowly zooms in on the static-filled gap; the silhouette in the foreground becomes slightly out of focus, creating a parallax effect with the screen in the background.

13. (119.30 - 132.76) - **Visual:** A final, powerful zoom-out. The shot starts as a microscopic view inside a silhouette's brain, showing beautiful, orderly, glowing circuits representing an "engineer." A dark, cancerous mass labeled "PARANOIA" begins to grow, tangling the circuits into a chaotic mess. The camera pulls back to reveal the silhouette is now wearing a suit, nervously looking over his shoulder—a "politician." The camera continues to pull back, revealing thousands of identical, paranoid silhouettes in a vast, dark space, each isolated and looking over their own shoulder. The parallax effect is immense, as the foreground silhouette shrinks, revealing the horrifying scale of the problem in the background.
