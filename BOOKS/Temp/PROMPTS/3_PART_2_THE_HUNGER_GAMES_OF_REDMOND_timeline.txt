4. (32.34 - 42.26) - a geometric vector illustration style of three groups of male silhouettes separated into green, yellow, and red zones, with a large manager's hand in the foreground placing a glowing red tag that reads "POOR" onto one of the figures in the red zone, with the words "POOR PERFORMERS" stenciled on the wall in the parallax background.

5. (42.26 - 50.48) - a geometric vector illustration style of a young male office worker silhouette with a large red 'X' on his chest, posing in shock and terror as a trapdoor opens beneath him in a dark boardroom, with the words "LET GO" above the dark pit in the parallax background.

6. (50.48 - 65.88) - a geometric vector illustration style of a manager silhouette in a suit, head in hands in a pose of despair, hesitating to place a red "FAILURE" tag on one of five glowing "superstar" employee silhouettes, with the old Microsoft logo and words "CORPORATE POLICY" on a large screen in the parallax background.

7. (65.88 - 73.36) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male manager silhouette plunging a glowing red dagger into the back of an unsuspecting colleague silhouette, whose body is contorted in shock, with the word "BRUTAL" scrawled like blood on the office wall in the parallax background.

8. (73.36 - 82.02) - a geometric vector illustration style of several male silhouettes in business attire standing on isolated platforms in an office designed like the Hunger Games arena, their poses defensive and suspicious, with the words "NO COLLABORATION" projected onto the floor from a central screen in the parallax background.

9. (82.02 - 90.34) - a geometric vector illustration style of two male silhouettes at adjacent desks, one climbing a ladder to success while using his foot to kick away the ladder of his struggling colleague, with a large "ZERO SUM" seesaw chart on the wall in the parallax background.

10. (90.34 - 98.76) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male silhouette in a hoodie crouched in the shadows, his pose sneaky as he sabotages a colleague's presentation by cutting a cable, with the word "SABOTAGE" circled in red on a whiteboard in the parallax background.

11. (90.76 - 105.16) - a geometric vector illustration style of executive silhouettes playing chess on a boardroom table, one character pointing an accusatory finger at another, with the words "CREDIT" and "BLAME" in an elegant font on a painting in the parallax background.

12. (105.16 - 118.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of a dejected engineer silhouette watching a brilliant lightbulb of "innovation" get crushed by a massive rusty machine, with a cracked and faded old Microsoft Windows logo on a decaying wall in the parallax background that reads "CRIPPLED INNOVATION".

13. (118.72 - 132.76) - a geometric vector illustration style of male engineer silhouettes transforming into paranoid politicians in suits hiding daggers behind their backs, their poses shifty and looking over their shoulders as black cancerous veins crawl across the office walls in the parallax background, and the word "PARANOID" flickers on a monitor.
