1. (0.00 - 11.32) - A 3D male silhouette in a business suit stands in the foreground, pointing quizzically up at a colossal, monolithic corporate building half-shrouded in a sickly green, toxic fog (parallax effect as fog swirls).
2. (11.78 - 14.26) - Interior of a glass corporate building. Several 3D silhouettes look up in alarm, bracing themselves as the structure cracks around them, with light bursting through the fractures, suggesting an imminent implosion (parallax effect as debris hangs in the air).
3. (14.78 - 20.76) - An older executive silhouette stands at a podium in a dark boardroom, presenting a downward-sloping graph that glows with an ominous red light. His gesture is confident but menacing (parallax effect with the glowing screen in the background).
4. (21.62 - 29.72) - A manager silhouette is slumped over a desk under a harsh spotlight, his hand being forced down onto a stack of papers by a large, shadowy hand from above, symbolizing forced grading (parallax effect as a background of endless office cubicles slowly scrolls by).
5. (30.32 - 42.26) - A manager silhouette stands before a line of his employees, reluctantly pointing at one person and pushing them from a neutral grey light into a dark red zone labeled "poor performers" (parallax effect as the light zones shimmer in the background).
6. (42.94 - 50.48) - A single, dejected male silhouette with his head hung low is pushed through a large, ominous doorway marked with a red target symbol, cast out from the bright corporate lobby into a dark, foggy exterior (parallax effect with the lobby moving in the foreground).
7. (51.04 - 65.88) - A manager silhouette stands in the center of a circle of five high-performing "superstar" silhouettes. The manager has his head in his hands, his posture conveying the agony of being forced to choose one to fail (parallax effect as the circle of superstars has a very slow, subtle rotation).
8. (66.40 - 73.36) - A close-up shot of two silhouettes in suits. One has his back turned confidently; the silhouette behind him raises a stylized, glowing dagger, his posture showing pain and conflict before the backstab (parallax effect as red and black fog swirls in the background).
9. (74.16 - 82.02) - An office space designed like a Roman colosseum. Multiple silhouettes sit with their backs to each other, isolated and defensive. The atmosphere is tense, collaboration is dead (parallax effect with a slow pan across the hostile, arena-like office).
10. (82.56 - 90.34) - Two silhouettes at adjacent desks. One reaches a hand out for help, while the other sharply turns away, shielding his own work with his arm, his gesture conveying cold refusal (parallax effect as glowing "0"s and "1"s flicker on screens in the background).
11. (90.84 - 95.78) - In a dark server room, one silhouette sneaks up behind an intently working colleague. The saboteur's hand reaches maliciously to pull a plug from the wall, his body language furtive and destructive (parallax effect with blinking server lights creating depth).
12. (96.56 - 105.16) - Silhouettes around a meeting table. Instead of collaborating, one is pointing an accusatory finger, another recoils from the blame, and a third subtly gestures to take credit, showing pure political maneuvering (parallax effect viewing the city lights moving through the glass walls behind them).
13. (105.80 - 118.72) - An innovator silhouette struggles to build with glowing blocks of light, but his arms are held back by heavy, dark chains connected to a massive corporate logo looming above him, crippling his progress (parallax effect with dust motes floating in the dark, empty space).
14. (119.30 - 123.92) - A team of silhouettes tries to build a glowing structure but they are simultaneously pulling each other down, their poses showing a chaotic, self-defeating struggle as the project collapses (parallax effect with other failing projects visible in the smoky background).
15. (124.38 - 132.76) - A brilliant engineer silhouette stands hunched and paranoid, his back covered in glowing daggers. A dark, cancerous texture rots the corporate logo on the wall behind him, symbolizing the deep corruption of the culture (parallax effect with the cancerous rot slowly spreading).
