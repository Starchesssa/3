1.(0.00-11.32)- A wide shot of a giant, monolithic tech company building. In the foreground, a massive, complex gear representing the company is grinding to a halt. The sky is dark and stormy. With a parallax effect, the clouds move quickly while the building and gear remain almost static, emphasizing the company's slowness.

2.(11.32-20.76)- The same monolithic building, but now it has large cracks forming on its facade, with dust and small pieces falling, as if it's about to implode. In the foreground, a close-up of a document titled in bold letters: "STACK RANKING".

3.(20.76-29.72)- A 3D male silhouette of a manager is sitting at a futuristic desk, looking stressed. He's interacting with a holographic display showing a large bell curve. Along the curve are smaller silhouettes of his employees. The manager's hand is hesitantly dragging one of the employee silhouettes toward the low end of the curve.

4.(29.72-42.26)- A close-up on the holographic bell curve. It's divided into three sections: a small green section at the top labeled "Top Performers," a large yellow section in the middle for "Average," and a small, glowing red section at the bottom labeled "Poor Performers." Silhouettes are being forcibly sorted into the sections.

5.(42.26-50.48)- Focus on the red "Poor Performers" section of the curve. A large red 'X' is stamped over one of the male silhouettes, which then starts to dissolve into pixels. In the background, out of focus, a single silhouette is seen exiting the main doors of the company building.

6.(50.48-65.88)- A manager silhouette stands before five brightly glowing silhouettes representing his "superstar" team. A giant, shadowy hand representing "corporate policy" descends from the top of the frame and forces the manager's hand to point at one of the glowing figures, causing its light to dim significantly.

7.(65.88-73.36)- A dramatic, high-contrast scene. A manager silhouette stands protectively in front of four of his team members. On the wall behind them, a long, sharp shadow is cast, depicting the manager stabbing the fifth team member in the back. The scene is lit from a single, harsh light source.

8.(73.36-82.02)- An office of cubicles is depicted as a dark, gladiatorial arena. The cubicle walls are high, like barriers. 2D male silhouettes peer suspiciously over the walls at each other instead of working. The atmosphere is tense, with a spotlight in the center of the room like in "The Hunger Games".

9.(82.02-90.34)- Two male silhouettes are sitting at desks side-by-side. They are positioned on opposite ends of a giant seesaw. As one silhouette works and a "SUCCESS" meter above him rises, his side of the seesaw goes up, causing the other silhouette's side to go down, visually representing a zero-sum game.

10.(90.34-95.78)- A split-screen view. On the left, a 3D silhouette is carefully building a complex project, represented by a tower of glowing blocks. On the right, another silhouette sneaks over and pulls a key block from the base of the tower, causing it to collapse into a heap.

11.(95.78-105.16)- A meeting room with several silhouettes around a table. Instead of collaborating, one silhouette shoves another into a red circle on the floor marked "BLAME," while simultaneously reaching for a golden trophy marked "CREDIT" in the center of the table.

12.(105.16-118.72)- A brilliant, intricate lightbulb symbolizing "INNOVATION" is being choked by dark, thorny vines that are slowly wrapping around it. The vines are labeled "STACK RANKING". With a parallax effect, the vines in the foreground slowly tighten and constrict, while in the background, a calendar shows ten years being crossed off.

13.(118.72-132.76)- A final wide shot of an office floor. Dozens of 3D male silhouettes who were once depicted as brilliant engineers with glowing minds are now shown transforming into hunched, shadowy figures looking over their shoulders at each other. The entire scene is tinted with a sickly, cancerous green color.
