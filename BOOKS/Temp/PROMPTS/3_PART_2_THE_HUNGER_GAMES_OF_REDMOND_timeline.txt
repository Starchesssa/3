1.  (0.00-11.32) - A giant, geometric corporate monolith figure in a pose of struggle, entangled in glowing toxic-green digital wires inside a dark, cyberpunk city in parallax.
2.  (11.78-14.26) - A colossal angular character, representing the company, in a pose of collapsing inward as it cracks and shatters into geometric shards, set against a glitching data-stream background in parallax.
3.  (14.78-20.76) - A single, menacing geometric hand pointing down from a dark sky, casting an oppressive shadow over a small angular figure who is recoiling in a pose of fear, all within a stark, noir city in parallax.
4.  (21.62-29.72) - An angular manager figure at a holographic desk, head in hands in a pose of despair, forced to arrange glowing employee profiles onto a harsh digital curve in a dark office environment in parallax.
5.  (30.32-42.26) - A line of sharp geometric figures being stamped by a giant mechanical arm; one figure is branded with a jagged red 'X' and flinches back in a pose of shock, inside a sterile, industrial setting in parallax.
6.  (42.94-50.48) - A single angular figure marked with a red 'X', in a desperate falling pose as the geometric floor disintegrates beneath them into a dark digital abyss, with other figures watching from a distance in parallax.
7.  (51.04-65.88) - A manager figure with a trembling, outstretched arm, in a pained and conflicted pose, forced to choose one of five heroically-posed superstar employees in a minimalist corporate chamber in parallax.
8.  (66.40-73.36) - A close-up of an angular manager figure from behind, head bowed in a pose of shame while holding a glowing geometric dagger, about to metaphorically stab an unsuspecting colleague in the back in a dark, moody office in parallax.
9.  (74.16-82.02) - A group of angular figures inside a digital arena, each in a defensive, hostile pose, turning their backs on one another with suspicion, within a glowing geometric cage in parallax.
10. (82.56-90.34) - Two angular figures at adjacent cubicles; one stumbles and reaches out for help, while the other turns away in a cold, self-preservationist pose, set against a dark, oppressive office background in parallax.
11. (90.84-95.78) - An angular figure in a sneaky, hunched pose, cutting a glowing data cable connected to a colleague’s desk, who in the background is in a pose of frustration at their blank screen, inside a neon-lit office in parallax.
12. (96.56-105.16) - Figures around a geometric boardroom table; one stands in an accusatory pose, pointing at another who cowers, while a third subtly pulls a glowing orb of 'credit' towards themself in a political maneuver, all in parallax.
13. (105.80-118.72) - A lone angular figure in a pose of futile effort, pushing against a massive, broken and rusted geometric gear labeled "INNOVATION" that is ensnared by glowing digital vines, in a decaying industrial landscape in parallax.
14. (119.30-132.76) - A crowd of sharp, angular figures in the foreground whispering and backstabbing in paranoid poses, while their transparent, creative engineer-ghosts fade away behind them inside a decaying corporate core in parallax.
