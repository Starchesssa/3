1.(0.00-11.32)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless character in a questioning pose, looking up at a colossal, slow-moving corporate building as toxic, angular vines creep from its base, all in parallax.

2.(11.32-16.42)- a geometric vector illustration style of faceless characters inside a crumbling, angular office, looking up in alarm as sharp shards fall from the ceiling, the words 'STACK RANKING' visible on a cracking wall, all in parallax.

3.(16.42-23.18)- a geometric vector illustration style of a single, menacing faceless manager leaning over a glowing blueprint, manipulating smaller figures like pawns in a dark, dramatically lit room, all in parallax.

4.(23.18-32.34)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless manager in a conflicted pose, chained to a desk and forced to sort character cards onto a giant, ominous bell curve on the wall, all in parallax.

5.(32.34-42.26)- a geometric vector illustration style of a line of faceless characters on three tiers: a high, bright platform for 'top,' a mid-level one for 'average,' and a low, crumbling platform for 'poor,' where one character is in a pose of despair, all in parallax.

6.(42.26-50.48)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless character with a red glow being pushed toward a dark chasm at the end of a long hallway, their pose one of futile resistance, all in parallax.

7.(50.48-60.76)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless manager proudly gesturing to his team of superstars, his pose shifting to fear as a massive, sharp triangular shadow looms over them, all in parallax.

8.(60.76-71.78)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless manager with head bowed in a shamed pose, hiding a sharp dagger behind his back while facing an unsuspecting team member, all in parallax.

9.(71.78-79.72)- a geometric vector illustration style of faceless characters in a stark, geometric office arena, circling each other in defensive, gladiatorial poses under harsh lighting, all in parallax.

10.(79.72-87.72)- a geometric vector illustration style of two faceless characters at back-to-back desks, one reaching for help while the other protectively clutches their work, a sharp, angular wall rising between them, all in parallax.

11.(87.72-95.78)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless character in a triumphant, crouching pose, secretly sabotaging a colleague's glowing project by pulling a cord from the shadows, all in parallax.

12.(95.78-105.16)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless character at a conference table in a pose of accusation, pointing at a cowering colleague while grabbing a glowing orb of 'credit' for themselves, all in parallax.

13.(105.16-115.92)- a geometric vector illustration style of a single faceless character standing with a somber, declarative pose amidst the wreckage of a complex geometric machine, signifying destroyed innovation, all in parallax.

14.(115.92-123.92)- a geometric vector illustration style of faceless characters furtively pulling blocks from each other's sections of a shared tower, causing the entire structure to lean precariously, all in parallax.

15.(123.92-132.76)- a geometric vector illustration style of a vast office where a dark, cancerous rot spreads from the core, turning the faceless engineers inside into paranoid figures hunched over their desks, all in parallax.
