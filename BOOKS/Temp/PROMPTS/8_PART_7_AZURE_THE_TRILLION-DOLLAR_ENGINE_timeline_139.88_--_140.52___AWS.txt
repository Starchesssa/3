1. (0.00-4.00) - A 2D/3D parallax image of a vast mountain range under a cloudy sky. On the very highest, sharpest peak, a flag with the letters "AWS" is planted, flapping in the wind, symbolizing its dominant market leader position. The clouds move slowly in the background, creating a sense of depth and scale.

2. (4.00-12.26) - The scene pans down the mountain. In the foreground, the 3D silhouette of a male leader stands on a rocky outcrop, pointing upwards with determination. Following his direction, another male silhouette is seen arduously climbing the steep face of the mountain, clawing for handholds. He is about to plant a second flag with "Azure" on it, establishing a clear number two position just below the peak. In the far, hazy background, other faint silhouettes are visible, shaking their heads in disbelief.

3. (12.26-20.04) - A low-angle shot of a 3D male silhouette's hand dropping a single, glowing blue chip onto a dark surface. The chip is labeled "Azure." As it lands, brilliant light erupts, projecting a massive, holographic, and futuristic city skyline that rises towards the sky, representing a multi-trillion-dollar valuation. The parallax effect shows the closest holographic buildings moving faster, giving the projection immense depth.

4. (20.04-23.70) - A close-up, dynamic shot of a massive, glowing blue engine. The word "Azure" is etched on its side. Intricate gears are turning and pistons are pumping with powerful energy. Blue light pulses from the engine's core, traveling along conduits that snake from the foreground into the background, powering up a vast, previously dark and dormant machine labeled "Microsoft," symbolizing the company's complete comeback.
