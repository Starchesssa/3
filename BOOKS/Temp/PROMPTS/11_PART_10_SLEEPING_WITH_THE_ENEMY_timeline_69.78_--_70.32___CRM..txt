**70.92 --> 74.72 :** In a dimly lit auditorium, Marc Benioff stands on a keynote stage, laughing, pointing mockingly at an old, pixelated Microsoft Windows logo projected on the giant screen behind him. The style is that of a photograph from the early 2010s tech scene.

**75.32 --> 77.72 :** A symbolic, cinematic shot of Satya Nadella and Marc Benioff, dressed in business suits, together in a field at dawn, shaking hands over a small, freshly filled hole in the ground where a hatchet has just been buried.

**78.08 --> 84.36 :** Photorealistic shot of Satya Nadella and Marc Benioff standing side-by-side on a brightly lit stage at a tech conference. They are smiling and shaking hands. On the massive screen behind them, the Salesforce logo and the Office 365 logo are joined by a plus sign.

**84.84 --> 89.32 :** A split-screen montage: on one side, diverse, happy professionals in a modern office collaborating using a computer screen that shows Salesforce and Microsoft Office software working together seamlessly.
