1. (69.78 - 74.72) - A 2D parallax image showing the letters 'CRM' on a digital background. The scene then transitions to a male silhouette on a stage, laughing and pointing mockingly at a large, corporate silhouette in the distance representing Microsoft.

2. (75.32 - 77.72) - A 3D parallax scene where two male silhouettes are shaking hands in front of a bright, optimistic background. In the foreground, between their feet, a literal hatchet is visibly buried in the ground.

3. (78.08 - 84.36) - A 2D parallax animation of abstract puzzle pieces connecting. One piece has a cloud icon (Salesforce), and it clicks into place with other pieces that have stylized icons for Office 365 and Windows, causing lines of light to connect them.

4. (84.84 - 89.32) - A 3D parallax image. In the foreground, several small silhouettes representing customers look up happily. In the background, two larger silhouettes, representing the companies, stand on rising platforms with glowing green upward-trending graphs behind them.

5. (89.94 - 92.54) - A 2D parallax montage. A central male silhouette remains still while a series of different male silhouettes slide in from the side, shake his hand, and slide out, creating a feeling of repetition and many deals being made.

6. (93.00 - 94.38) - A 3D parallax view from a low angle looking up at a brightly lit stage. One male silhouette stands at a podium, turning to welcome another silhouette who is walking into the spotlight.
