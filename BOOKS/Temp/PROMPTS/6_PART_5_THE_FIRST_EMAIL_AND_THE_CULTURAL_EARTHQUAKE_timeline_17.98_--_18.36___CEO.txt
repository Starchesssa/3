**17.98 --> 21.90**
Quick cuts: A packed press conference with flashing cameras, then a brightly lit, empty product launch stage. A subtle "X" animates over the images.

**22.34 --> 27.70**
Close-up on a computer screen. An email is being composed. The camera focuses on the "To:" field, where "All Employees" is typed. A number counter rapidly spins up to "100,000+". Close-up on a finger clicking "Send".

**28.14 --> 30.48**
Animated graphic: An email icon lands in the center of the screen, and a powerful but subtle shockwave radiates outwards, rippling through stylized icons of office buildings around the globe.

**31.16 --> 36.22**
Animated text and logos: The words "BEATING GOOGLE" and "CRUSHING APPLE" appear on screen, then are aggressively crossed out. The classic Windows logo appears and then gently fades away.

**36.64 --> 40.72**
The words "EMPATHY" and "A DESIRE TO LEARN" materialize on screen in a soft, encouraging font. Simple, clean icons appear next to them: a heart inside a speech bubble and an open book.

**41.26 --> 46.74**
Text of the quote appears on screen: "Our industry does not respect tradition. It only respects innovation." As "tradition" is spoken, the font is an old-style serif that crumbles into dust. As "innovation" is spoken, it appears in a clean, modern, glowing font.

**47.32 --> 54.42**
Animation of a brain with gears inside. The gears are depicted as rusty and stuck. They suddenly break free, reconfigure, and begin to turn smoothly and brightly.

**54.80 --> 62.86**
Stylized animation of a corporate meeting. Silhouetted figures sit around a table with rigid, closed-off body language. One figure is shown with a bright spotlight on them, as if they are the only one allowed to be right. The text "KNOW-IT-ALL" stamps over the scene.

**63.36 --> 66.74**
The "KNOW-IT-ALL" text from the previous scene dramatically cracks and shatters into pieces.

**67.22 --> 72.74**
The shattered fragments from the "Know-it-all" text reassemble to form the words "LEARN-IT-ALLS". The scene transitions to a bright, collaborative workspace. People are sketching ideas on a whiteboard, and speech bubbles with question marks appear, turning into lightbulbs. A final, hopeful shot of a person looking up with an inquisitive and open expression.
