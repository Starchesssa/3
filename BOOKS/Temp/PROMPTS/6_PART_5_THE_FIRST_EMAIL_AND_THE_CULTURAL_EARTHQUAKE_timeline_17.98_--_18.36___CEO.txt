1.  (17.98 - 21.90) - A 2D/3D parallax image of an empty stage with a single spotlight on a podium. In the background, the faint silhouettes of a press corps and flashing cameras are faded out, representing the giant press conference that never happened.
2.  (21.90 - 28.14) - A stylized 3D email icon floats in the foreground. In the parallax background, a vast, abstract network of over 100,000 glowing male silhouettes representing employees receives the message simultaneously.
3.  (28.14 - 31.16) - The 3D email icon is now at the center of radiating 2D shockwaves, like an earthquake's epicenter. The background network of silhouettes and the ground beneath them appear to crack and shake from the impact.
4.  (31.16 - 36.64) - A 2D/3D parallax composition. In the foreground, stylized icons—a bitten apple, a search magnifying glass, and a window—are crossed out with a bold red 'X' and are being pushed off-screen.
5.  (36.64 - 41.26) - A 2D parallax close-up of a male silhouette's head in profile. Inside, a glowing 3D heart (empathy) and an open book (desire to learn) are visible, with soft light connecting them.
6.  (41.26 - 47.32) - A 2D/3D parallax scene showing a split screen. On the left, a crumbling, ancient stone pillar representing "Tradition" is decaying. On the right, a vibrant, glowing digital network representing "Innovation" is pulsing with energy and growing.
7.  (47.32 - 56.88) - A 3D parallax view of a stark, grey meeting room. A group of male silhouettes stands rigidly, each with a solid, opaque sphere over their head, symbolizing the closed-off "know-it-all" mindset.
8.  (56.88 - 63.36) - A 2D parallax zoom-in on one male silhouette in a room, posturing with his chest puffed out, trying to be the "smartest person." The other silhouettes around him are smaller and in the background, looking away.
9.  (63.36 - 67.22) - The entire "know-it-all" scene from the previous shot dramatically shatters like glass in a 3D parallax effect. The shards fly outwards, symbolizing the declaration that this culture must "die right now."
10. (67.22 - 72.74) - From the shattered pieces, a new, bright scene emerges. A group of male silhouettes are collaborating. Their thought bubbles are now transparent, showing glowing question marks and lightbulbs, with 2D lines of light connecting them in a "learn-it-all" network.
