1.  **(0.00 - 10.54)** - A 3D silhouette of a CEO stands alone in a vast, dark, virtual boardroom. In the foreground, a constant, blurry stream of digital emails with generic praise ("Great Quarter!", "Keep up the good work!") fly past the camera, creating a parallax effect. In the distant background, a massive, complex organizational chart of Microsoft flickers like a dying hologram. The CEO silhouette ignores the emails, his gaze fixed on the broken structure in the distance, his posture conveying immense weight and decision.

2.  **(10.88 - 15.32)** - The scene shifts to a stark, stylized corporate graveyard under a gray sky. In the midground, a massive, ornate tombstone is carved with an old, pixelated Windows logo and the epitaph: "The Old Way of Thinking." A single 3D silhouette stands before it, then turns and walks decisively out of the frame, leaving the tombstone to the shadows. In the foreground, digital dust motes float slowly through a single beam of light, creating depth.

3.  **(16.00 - 23.48)** - A dark, cavernous factory floor. In the midground, glitching 2D silhouettes, like zombies, work on a slow-moving assembly line, piecing together obsolete Nokia phones that fall into a massive, overflowing junk pile. In the foreground, a giant, semi-transparent digital price tag hovers, its numbers rapidly counting up and stopping at "$7,000,000,000." A lone CEO silhouette watches the entire scene from a darkened control room in the background.

4.  **(24.08 - 32.60)** - A dramatic, slow-motion shot in a sterile, white room. A massive, complex financial ledger is projected onto a floor-to-ceiling glass wall. The CEO silhouette stands before it and, with a single, sharp gesture on a tablet, a thick, digital red line is drawn through the entire projection. The numbers and text on the glass wall shatter and fall away into nothingness like digital shards, some floating slowly in the foreground.

5.  **(33.02 - 39.28)** - An animated infographic sequence. A stylized 3D model of the Microsoft headquarters is shown. A massive, glowing red block labeled "$7.6 BILLION CHARGE" descends from the sky and slams into the building model, causing a digital shockwave to ripple outwards. In the foreground, stock ticker symbols for MSFT flicker nervously against a black background.

6.  **(39.84 - 47.38)** - We see a single 3D silhouette standing on a stark, elevated stage, illuminated by a single spotlight. He gestures towards the midground, where a massive bonfire of burning cash (represented by glowing green dollar-sign particles) rages. In the foreground, the blurred, dark silhouettes of reporters and investors watch from the shadows, creating a deep parallax effect against the black void of the background.

7.  **(48.12 - 59.06)** - The camera is positioned behind the CEO silhouette on stage, looking out at a giant screen. The screen displays a complex blueprint labeled "DEVICES & SERVICES STRATEGY." The silhouette raises a hand, and a huge, visceral, red "X" is stamped over the blueprint with a thunderous sound. The words "DISASTER" and "OVER" flash on the screen before it cuts to black. The audience silhouettes in the foreground remain perfectly still.

8.  **(59.80 - 67.00)** - A cold, top-down, god's-eye view of a vast, multi-level office floor plan, rendered in blueprint style. We see 18,000 small, 2D human icons at their desks. A slow, digital wave of red washes over the floor plan, causing the icons to fade out row by row, floor by floor, until the building is mostly empty. The different floors fading at slightly different speeds creates the parallax.

9.  **(67.54 - 80.82)** - A highly stylized medical animation. A glowing, 3D wireframe of the Microsoft corporate structure is shown. A dark, pulsing tumor labeled "DEVICES STRATEGY" grows within it. A precise beam of light, like a surgical laser, cuts into the structure and cleanly excises the growth, which dissolves into dust. In the foreground, streams of clean, blue data begin to flow smoothly through the newly healed structure.

10. **(81.32 - 87.32)** - A 3D silhouette stands at a crossroads. One path leads to a crumbling cliff edge where other silhouettes are seen shoveling piles of money into a chasm labeled "EGO." The main silhouette decisively turns down the other path, which is clean, well-lit, and leads towards a glowing server farm in the distance. The money falling into the chasm provides a dynamic foreground element.

11. **(88.12 - 99.04)** - A grand, temple-like hall. In the center, on a massive pedestal, sits a giant, glowing Windows logo, treated like a sacred idol. All around it, hundreds of 2D silhouettes are bowing and chanting in unison. The camera slowly pans across the scene of obsessive devotion. In the foreground, vertical streams of Windows source code scroll upwards, partially obscuring the view.

12. **(99.58 - 107.66)** - A split-screen. On the left, in a bright, modern space, happy silhouettes use sleek tablets (iPads). Above them, Microsoft Office logos appear, but are grayed out and inaccessible. On the right, in a dark, gothic boardroom, a large, intimidating silhouette (representing the old guard) slams his fist on a table. The word "HERESY" is stamped across his side of the screen in brutalist, red typography.

13. **(108.20 - 123.10)** - An abstract visualization inside a neural network. A huge, central neuron labeled "WINDOWS FIRST" pulses with domineering light. A new signal arrives, and the network rapidly rewires itself. Two new neurons, "CLOUD FIRST" and "MOBILE FIRST," ignite with equal brightness, pushing the "WINDOWS" neuron to become one of three equal parts of a new, balanced system. The text labels animate into place.

14. **(123.70 - 133.84)** - A 3D silhouette of the CEO is on a minimalist stage. He holds up a tablet. The camera does a dramatic push-in to the screen, where we see the iconic interfaces of Word and Excel running perfectly. The Apple logo on the back of the device subtly gleams. In the background, a giant screen mirrors the demonstration. In the extreme foreground, abstract UI elements and data packets flow gracefully across the frame.

15. **(134.46 - 139.98)** - A quick cut to a stylized Microsoft campus. Inside glass-walled offices, 2D silhouettes of employees freeze in place, their heads all snapping towards unseen screens in stunned disbelief. This is intercut with a powerful metaphor: a silhouette in pope-like robes stands before the Windows "temple" and gives a blessing to a competing icon—a glowing, stylized apple.

16. **(140.52 - 147.72)** - An animated world map. Thousands of customer silhouettes are dotted across it, using various devices. From a central point labeled "MSFT," glowing lines of service extend outwards, connecting to *all* the icons, explicitly wrapping around devices that have glowing Apple and Android logos on them. The lines of service flow in the foreground, creating a sense of global reach.

17. **(148.28 - 153.58)** - A war-torn battlefield littered with the broken, rusted logos of old tech companies. A silhouette in heavy armor, with a Windows logo on his helmet, slowly takes the helmet off. He drops his sword and shield, which dissolve into pixels. He turns, and the background battlefield transforms into a bright, clean, endless server farm representing the cloud.

18. **(154.26 - 163.38)** - A rapid, dynamic montage of the key visuals: the red line shattering the ledger, the burning money, the laser surgery, the glowing iPad on stage. The cuts accelerate, building to a climax where a single 3D silhouette presses a large, glowing button labeled "REFRESH." The screen flashes white, and the new, simple, four-square Microsoft logo fades into view, clean and centered. Faint, ghost-like images of the montage float in the foreground before fading away.
