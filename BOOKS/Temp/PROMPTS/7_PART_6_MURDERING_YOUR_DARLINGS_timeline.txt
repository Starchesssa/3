1.(0.00-10.54) - A 3D angular character in a burdened, contemplative pose, looking out a vast window at a geometric cyberpunk city in parallax.
2.(10.88-15.32) - A 3D angular character in a dominant pose, one foot crushing a shattered, glowing, old-tech monitor in a dark, minimalist room in parallax.
3.(16.00-23.48) - A 3D angular character in a hunter's crouch, aiming an energy weapon at a glitching, zombie-like monolith shaped like a smartphone in a decaying server room in parallax.
4.(24.08-32.60) - A 3D angular character in a dynamic pose, slicing through a holographic financial chart with a sharp energy blade in a dark data-scape in parallax.
5.(33.02-47.38) - A 3D angular character in a solitary, resolute pose on a dark stage, a giant screen behind him showing a crashing red data line in parallax.
6.(48.12-59.06) - A 3D angular character in a grim, determined pose, pressing a large button that shatters a complex abstract structure in a brutalist concrete chamber in parallax.
7.(59.80-71.66) - A 3D angular character with his back to the viewer, in a rigid pose of pained acceptance, watching thousands of smaller data silhouettes dissolve from a glowing wall in parallax.
8.(72.14-87.32) - A 3D angular character in a surgeon's focused pose, using precise laser tools to extract a dark, corrupted geometric core from a glowing machine in a sterile lab in parallax.
9.(88.12-99.04) - A 3D angular character in a powerful mid-swing with a giant geometric hammer, about to shatter a glowing monolith shaped like a window pane in a digital temple in parallax.
10.(99.58-116.32) - Two 3D angular characters in opposing, defiant poses on either side of a glowing chasm in a stark, divided landscape in parallax.
11.(117.04-123.10) - A 3D angular character in a forward-looking pose, deliberately turning a large holographic compass away from a window icon and toward a cloud icon in a data-scape in parallax.
12.(123.70-133.84) - A 3D angular character in a proud, confident pose on a tech stage, holding a glowing tablet up for an unseen audience in parallax.
13.(134.46-139.98) - Multiple 3D angular characters in recoiling, shocked poses, reacting to a central figure holding two rival logos now joined as one in a vast atrium in parallax.
14.(140.52-153.58) - A 3D angular character in a humble, kneeling pose, offering a glowing orb of light to a smaller abstract silhouette in a clean, minimalist environment in parallax.
15.(154.26-163.38) - A 3D angular character in a powerful, balanced pose, holding a jagged red energy in one hand and a smooth blue energy in the other, in a split dark-and-light environment in parallax.
