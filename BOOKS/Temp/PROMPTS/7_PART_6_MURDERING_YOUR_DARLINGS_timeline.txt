1.(0.00-10.54)- A 3D male silhouette representing a CEO stands in a dark, high-tech office, looking out a massive window at a sprawling, illuminated city at night. The camera is behind him, creating a sense of powerful contemplation. With a parallax effect, the desk and a glowing tablet in the foreground are slightly blurred, the CEO silhouette is the sharp mid-ground focus, and the city lights in the background slowly drift as the camera pushes in.

2.(10.88-15.32)- A symbolic scene showing a crumbling, monolithic concrete block with an old, outdated company logo engraved on it. A single 2D male silhouette stands watching it fall apart into dust. Using a parallax effect, dust particles float in the foreground, the crumbling monolith is the central focus, and a clean, modern architectural background comes into view, signifying a new era.

3.(16.00-23.48)- A dramatic scene inside a corporate boardroom. On a large presentation screen, a financial chart shows a catastrophic downward trend labeled "Mobile Phone Division." Below it, in stark red letters, is the figure "$7 Billion Zombie Asset." A 3D male silhouette stands pointing at the screen, while other silhouettes seated at the table look on with serious expressions. The parallax effect shows a blurred water glass on the table in the foreground, the silhouettes in the mid-ground, and the screen in the background.

4.(24.08-32.60)- A close-up shot of a 3D male silhouette's hand holding a pen, hesitating for a moment before decisively signing a document. The document is a financial statement where the only visible text is a massive write-off figure: "-$7,600,000,000." A parallax effect is used with the corner of a leather-bound folder blurred in the extreme foreground, the hand and document as the sharp mid-ground focus, and the dimly lit, luxurious office interior soft in the background.

5.(33.02-47.38)- A 3D male silhouette stands alone at a press conference podium. He is facing a barrage of flashing lights from an unseen press corps. On the giant screen behind him, a stock ticker is shown plummeting downwards next to the company logo. The parallax effect creates depth with the flashing light flares in the foreground, the lone silhouette at the podium in the mid-ground, and the dynamic stock ticker animation on the screen in the background.

6.(48.12-59.06)- A stylized shot of a smartphone, representing the failed business, lying shattered on a dark, reflective floor. A single spotlight from above illuminates the broken glass. The silhouette of a CEO is reflected on the screen, turning and walking away from the wreckage. A parallax effect is created by floating dust motes in the foreground light beam, the broken phone in the mid-ground, and the moving reflection in the background.

7.(59.80-67.00)- A somber, wide shot of a massive, empty office floor with rows upon rows of vacant desks and computers. In the middle of the room, a single 2D male silhouette is seen packing his belongings from a desk into a cardboard box. The parallax effect shows a blurred empty chair in the foreground, the lone employee silhouette in the mid-ground, and the vast, repeating pattern of empty workstations stretching into the background.

8.(67.54-80.82)- An abstract, medical-style animation shows a glowing, digital brain representing the company. A cancerous, dark mass labeled "DEVICES STRATEGY" is being precisely removed by a laser scalpel. Once removed, the brain's neural pathways light up and realign into a clean, efficient grid. The parallax effect has glowing data particles in the foreground, the brain and scalpel in the mid-ground, and the forming grid in the background.

9.(88.12-99.04)- A symbolic scene inside a grand, sterile hall. In the center, the iconic Windows logo is enshrined on a stone pedestal like a sacred relic. A 2D male silhouette, representing the new leadership, stands before it, holding a sledgehammer, casting a long shadow. The parallax effect shows a velvet rope stanchion in the foreground, the silhouette and pedestal in the mid-ground, and the cavernous hall with high archways in the background.

10.(99.58-110.18)- A split-screen image. On the left, silhouettes of customers are shown using tablets, looking frustrated as a "SOFTWARE NOT AVAILABLE" message pops up. On the right, an imposing 2D silhouette of a leader stands with arms crossed, guarding a fortress with "WINDOWS" written over the gate, preventing entry. A parallax effect adds depth to each side independently.

11.(110.72-123.10)- A 3D male silhouette, representing the new CEO, stands at a digital crossroads. One path leads to a walled, isolated city labeled "WINDOWS FIRST." The other, brighter path leads towards a sky filled with interconnected clouds and various mobile device icons. The silhouette is clearly choosing the "CLOUD FIRST" path. The parallax effect shows the weathered crossroads sign in the foreground, the silhouette in the mid-ground, and the two diverging paths stretching into the distance.

12.(123.70-133.84)- A 3D male silhouette stands on a bright presentation stage, holding up an Apple iPad. On the massive screen behind him, a flawless demonstration of Microsoft Office is running on the device. The audience is represented by a field of blurred lens flares. The parallax effect has the edge of the stage floor in the foreground, the presenter and iPad in the mid-ground, and the giant demo screen in the background.

13.(134.46-139.98)- A shot from inside a Microsoft office where several 2D silhouettes are huddled around a computer monitor, watching the live presentation. Their postures convey utter shock—one has his hands on his head, another is pointing at the screen in disbelief. Using a parallax effect, a coffee mug on a desk is blurred in the foreground, the stunned silhouettes are in the mid-ground, and the office environment with posters on the wall is in the background.

14.(140.52-150.58)- An abstract, symbolic image. A central 2D silhouette, representing Microsoft, extends an open hand. Lighted data streams flow from the hand towards a diverse array of other silhouettes representing customers, each holding a different device (laptop, phone, tablet). The parallax effect shows flowing lines of code in the foreground, the connecting silhouettes in the mid-ground, and a soft, glowing network grid in the background.

15.(151.02-163.38)- A final, powerful image of a book opening. The left page, titled "The Past," shows a stark, cracked smartphone. The right page, titled "The Future," shows a vibrant graphic of software icons working seamlessly across multiple devices. A 3D silhouette's hand is turning the page from left to right. A parallax effect shows the corner of the book blurred in the foreground, the detailed pages and hand in focus, and a bright, optimistic, modern office softly blurred in the background.
