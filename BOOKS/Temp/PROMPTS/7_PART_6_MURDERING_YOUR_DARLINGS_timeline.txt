1.(0.00-10.54)- A 3D male silhouette representing a CEO stands at a metaphorical crossroads inside a vast, abstract corporate space. One path is brightly lit with floating icons of emails and smiley faces. The other path is darker, more challenging, with jagged, abstract shapes representing difficult choices. The silhouette is turned towards the darker path, contemplating. The parallax effect shows the depth of the two paths stretching into the distance.
2.(10.54-15.32)- A close-up shot of a 3D male silhouette swinging a metaphorical hammer, shattering a large, stone tablet. The tablet is inscribed with the words "THE OLD WAY" and is cracking apart, with dust and fragments flying outwards. The background is a blurry office environment, emphasizing the impact of the action.
3.(15.32-23.48)- A wide shot showing a 3D male silhouette standing resolutely on one side. On the other side, a monstrous, zombie-like creature constructed from outdated mobile phones and glowing dollar signs lumbers forward, its shadow cast over a miniature city skyline representing the company. The silhouette points decisively towards the "zombie." The parallax effect creates distance between the CEO and the monster.
4.(23.48-32.60)- A dramatic shot of a 3D male silhouette holding a giant, glowing red digital pen. He decisively strikes through a massive, holographic ledger screen that displays the figure "$7.6 BILLION" and the Nokia logo. The red strike mark sizzles as it appears.
5.(32.60-47.38)- A 3D male silhouette stands on a stage under a single spotlight, facing an unseen audience. Behind him, a giant screen displays a bar chart. A blue bar labeled "ACQUISITION COST" is next to a massive, growing red bar labeled "WRITE-OFF: $7.6B" which towers over it. Digital money symbols are seen disintegrating as they fall from the red bar.
6.(47.38-59.06)- A symbolic scene where a 3D male silhouette stands before a crumbling monument labeled "DEVICES & SERVICES STRATEGY." As he speaks, the monument cracks further and collapses into a pile of dust and rubble. The words "IT IS OVER" appear in bold, stark letters in the dust cloud. The parallax effect shows the background remaining still as the monument falls in the foreground.
7.(59.06-67.00)- A somber, bird's-eye view of a vast grid filled with thousands of 2D male silhouettes. The number "18,000" materializes in the center, and a wave effect causes a large portion of the silhouettes to fade out, leaving stark, empty spaces behind.
8.(67.00-80.82)- A metaphorical, high-tech scene. A large, glowing sphere representing the "Company Core" has a dark, pulsing growth attached to it labeled "DEVICES STRATEGY". A precise, surgical laser beam cuts the growth away. Once severed, the dark mass dissolves, and the main sphere glows brighter and healthier.
9.(80.82-93.20)- A 3D male silhouette is shown turning his back on a bonfire of burning monopoly-like money representing "Bad Investments". In the distance, seen through a window, a huge, golden statue shaped like the Windows logo (representing a "sacred cow") comes into sharp focus, looming over the corporate landscape. Use parallax to make the statue seem immense.
10.(93.20-99.04)- An animation of a solar system where the sun is a giant, glowing Windows logo. Numerous smaller planets, representing different Microsoft departments, are shown revolving around it in strict, concentric orbits.
11.(99.04-107.66)- A split-screen view. On the left, the rigid "Windows Solar System" continues to spin. On the right, a massive wave of 2D silhouettes using tablets with a glowing apple logo is shown. From this wave, icons for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint float upwards towards the left side of the screen, representing customer demand.
12.(107.66-116.32)- A different, more rigid 3D male silhouette stands guard at a metaphorical wall separating a "Windows" territory from an "Apple" territory. He holds up his hands to block floating Office app icons from crossing over. The word "NEVER!" is stamped across the screen in a heavy, authoritarian font.
13.(116.32-123.10)- The "Windows Solar System" is shown again. A 3D male silhouette gestures, and the entire system reconfigures itself. The Windows logo moves from the center to become a planet, and a new, glowing Cloud icon becomes the central sun. The text "Cloud First, Mobile First" animates on screen.
14.(123.10-133.84)- A 3D male silhouette stands on a brightly lit stage. He holds up a sleek tablet, clearly showing the Microsoft Office suite running on it. A camera zooms in on the tablet, and a subtle glint reveals an apple logo on its back. The parallax effect shows the vast, blurry audience in the background.
15.(133.84-139.98)- A series of quick cuts showing 2D silhouettes in office cubicles reacting in shock. They look up from their computers with exclamation points appearing above their heads. One silhouette is shown looking at a poster of the Windows logo, which briefly flickers to show an Apple logo, symbolizing the "heresy".
16.(139.98-150.58)- A stylized animation where a silhouette labeled "Microsoft" lays down a sword and shield. It then builds a bridge across a chasm to reach another silhouette, representing a "Customer," who is standing on a platform with an Apple logo. The text "We go where our customers are" appears on the bridge.
17.(150.58-163.38)- A final split-screen image. On the left, the dissolving remains of the "Nokia phone zombie." On the right, the bridge connecting Microsoft to its customers on other platforms. In the center, a 3D hand presses a large, glowing button labeled "REFRESH." As it's pressed, a wave of clean, blue light radiates from the center, sweeping across both scenes and making them brighter.
