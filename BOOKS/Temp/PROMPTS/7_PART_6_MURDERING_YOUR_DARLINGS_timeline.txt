1.(0.00-10.54)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a middle-aged CEO in a dark suit with a featureless angular head, standing thoughtfully at a large window. In the parallax background, the word "BRUTAL" is subtly embedded in the geometric cityscape, while glowing, abstract email icons drift past him.

2.(10.88-15.32)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a man in a suit with an angular, featureless head, turning his back resolutely on a large, crumbling, monolithic statue. The statue has the word "TRADITION" cracked across its base, with a clean, modern cityscape rising in the parallax background.

3.(16.00-23.48)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a CEO in a sharp suit with a featureless angular head, pointing decisively towards a large, shambling, geometric figure made of outdated phone components. The Nokia logo is faded on the figure's chest as green dollar signs are siphoned away from a Microsoft logo in the parallax background.

4.(24.08-32.60)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a man in a suit with a blank angular head, making a sweeping motion with his arm. In front of him, a giant, glowing number "$7.6 BILLION" is being struck through with a thick, red, angular line, calming a chaotic storm of financial symbols in the parallax background.

5.(33.02-47.38)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a man in a suit with an angular, featureless head, standing at a podium with arms slightly spread in a gesture of honest admission. On a giant screen in the parallax background, the words "WASTED MONEY" are displayed in a bold, geometric font.

6.(48.12-59.06)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a CEO with a featureless angular head, standing over a shattered, geometric representation of a smartphone. He holds a stylized, angular axe resting on his shoulder. In the parallax background, the word "DISASTER" is projected in a stark, red font.

7.(59.80-71.66)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a CEO with a blank angular head, standing still and watching as a long line of other faceless silhouettes fades into a distant horizon. In the parallax background, the number "18,000" dissolves like digital dust in the air.

8.(72.14-87.32)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a man in a surgeon's uniform with a featureless angular head, precisely holding a glowing scalpel over a complex company blueprint. He is carefully excising a dark section labeled "DEVICES". In the parallax background, a cracked mask representing "EGO" lies discarded.

9.(88.12-99.04)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a CEO with a featureless angular head in a dynamic pose, shattering a massive, glowing stained-glass window that prominently features the classic Windows logo. Shards of geometric glass fly outwards in a parallax effect.

10.(99.58-116.32)- a geometric vector illustration style of a large, imposing 3D silhouette of a man with an angular head, standing with arms crossed, guarding a massive wall with a glowing Windows logo. The word "NEVER" is etched into the wall he guards, with a stylized Apple logo visible in the parallax background.

11.(117.04-123.10)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a visionary CEO with a featureless angular head, looking out at a new horizon. The sky is filled with glowing, interconnected icons of clouds and mobile devices, with the words "MOBILE FIRST" integrated into the parallax background.

12.(123.70-133.84)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a CEO with a blank angular head, standing proudly on a stage and holding up a glowing, stylized tablet. The tablet screen clearly shows the Microsoft Office logo running inside an Apple logo outline.

13.(134.46-142.56)- a geometric vector illustration style of a group of 3D silhouettes in office attire with angular, featureless heads, all frozen in poses of complete shock. They are looking at a large screen in the parallax background which displays an Apple logo and a Microsoft logo shaking hands.

14.(143.10-153.58)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a CEO with a featureless angular head, kneeling slightly to offer a glowing, abstract tool to another silhouette representing a customer. In the parallax background, the words "CUSTOMERS FIRST" are elegantly displayed.

15.(154.26-163.38)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette of a CEO standing confidently in the center of a split-screen composition. On the left, a dark scene with the debris of a shattered phone. On the right, a bright scene with Microsoft and Apple logos connected. The words "HIT REFRESH" are boldly written across the central dividing line.
