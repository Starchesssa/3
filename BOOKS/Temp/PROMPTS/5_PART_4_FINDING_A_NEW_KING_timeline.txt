1. (0.00 - 9.84) - A 3D male silhouette on a dark stage turns away from a microphone. Behind him, a giant, cracked smartphone screen flickers erratically in a hazy blue light. Parallax effect with the stage floor in the foreground.

2. (9.84 - 17.60) - An ornate, empty CEO chair sits in a single, harsh spotlight. A chaotic circle of press silhouettes with flashbulb cameras surrounds it, their forms blurred by a swirling blue fog. Parallax effect with camera flashes in the foreground.

3. (17.60 - 29.30) - In a dark boardroom, several 3D male silhouettes hunch over a long table, frantically looking at scattered papers. A large window behind them reveals a stormy city skyline, lit by blue lightning. Parallax effect with the corner of the table in the foreground.

4. (29.30 - 36.84) - A 3D male silhouette stands inside a glass box filled with swirling toxic-blue fog. Outside the box, a second silhouette in clear air looks in, observing him. Parallax effect with reflections on the glass in the foreground.

5. (36.84 - 55.64) - A lone 3D male silhouette stands confidently on a pile of rusted metal parts. A powerful spotlight cuts through the blue haze, illuminating him from above. Parallax effect with rusted gears in the foreground.

6. (55.64 - 78.80) - Two large, imposing 3D male silhouettes sit on thrones overlooking a pit. A third, smaller silhouette stands at the edge, turns, and walks away from the pit, which is filled with snake-like shapes made of blue fog. Parallax effect with the stone edge of the pit in the foreground.

7. (78.80 - 89.76) - An ornate goblet sits on a pedestal in a vast, empty hall. It is filled with a dark liquid that emits a sinister, toxic-blue glow, casting long shadows. Parallax effect with the floor tiles in the foreground.

8. (89.76 - 106.74) - A calm 3D male silhouette stands in a server room. Endless racks of servers with blinking blue lights stretch into the background, creating a digital infinity. Parallax effect with a blurry server rack in the foreground.

9. (106.74 - 117.28) - A split screen. Left: A 3D silhouette pounds its fist on a table, creating shockwaves. Right: A different 3D silhouette sits calmly, with glowing blue lines of code floating gently around him. Parallax effect makes the code/shockwaves appear in front of the silhouettes.

10. (117.28 - 129.42) - A board of 3D silhouettes huddles together, looking across an empty space at a lone silhouette. Behind the lone figure, a complex, tangled knot is projected on the wall, glowing in the blue light. Parallax effect with the board members out of focus in the foreground.

11. (129.42 - 149.64) - A massive, featureless silhouette of a giant sits slumped in a vast, dark space. The entire scene is filled with a thick, leaderless blue fog, with dust motes floating in the foreground. Parallax effect creates depth in the fog.
