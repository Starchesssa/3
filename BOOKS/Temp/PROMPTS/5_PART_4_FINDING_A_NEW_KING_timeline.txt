1. (0.00 - 9.84) - A sleek Nokia Lumia smartphone hangs in a black void. It suddenly cracks and shatters in ultra-slow motion. The shards of glass drift apart and morph into a line of falling dominoes. The camera follows the dominoes as they topple, leading to a final, large domino which is a sweating, heavy-set **2D male silhouette** (representing Ballmer) standing on a platform labeled "CEO." As he steps off, the platform crumbles. A calendar page for "AUGUST 2013" flies into the foreground, momentarily obscuring the scene with a parallax effect where the date appears closer than the falling silhouette.

2. (10.48 - 17.60) - A minimalist graphic timeline of Microsoft's history appears. Two pedestals are occupied by simple silhouettes labeled "1. GATES" and "2. BALLMER." A third, empty pedestal flashes with a giant, red, blinking question mark. The scene cross-fades into a stylized circus tent. **3D silhouettes** of board members are running frantically in circles, juggling flaming Microsoft logos under a spotlight, creating a sense of chaotic panic. The parallax effect shows the foreground silhouettes moving faster than the ones in the background.

3. (18.30 - 25.32) - A long, dark boardroom table is seen from a low angle. At the head, a **3D silhouette** labeled "CHAIRMAN JOHN THOMPSON" has his head in his hands. Other silhouettes gesture wildly. In the center of the table, a complex 3D model of a corporate structure, visualized as a tangled, steaming mess of rusty pipes, glows an unhealthy red. Text annotations like "STACK RANKING" and "INFIGHTING" flicker on the pipes. With a parallax effect, the steam from the pipes drifts in the foreground, partially obscuring the anxious silhouettes in the background.

4. (25.50 - 36.84) - A stylized globe spins in the center of the screen. Searchlights, originating from a Microsoft logo in Redmond, WA, frantically scan the map. One beam locks onto a lone **2D silhouette** standing outside a swirling, murky green cloud labeled "MICROSOFT CULTURE." Inside the cloud, other indistinct silhouettes can be seen bumping into each other aimlessly. The parallax effect is created by having the cloud's layers of mist move at different speeds, while the external silhouette remains crisp in the foreground.

5. (37.46 - 51.46) - A fast-paced montage. A magazine cover materializes with a confident **2D male silhouette** (representing Mulally) and the headline "THE TURNAROUND KING." This dissolves into a graphic animation: the same silhouette holds up a collapsing factory building labeled "FORD" with one hand, while simultaneously waving away a bag of money labeled "GOVERNMENT BAILOUT" with the other. The words "LEGENDARY FEAT" are stamped across the screen in a bold font. The parallax is seen in the dust and debris from the collapsing factory floating in front of the silhouette.

6. (52.00 - 62.84) - An explosion of media. Newspaper headlines and website screenshots featuring Mulally's silhouette and the Microsoft logo fly towards and past the camera from all directions. "MULALLY TO REDMOND?" "FORD CEO IS MICROSOFT'S SAVIOR," "THE PERFECT CHOICE." The motion accelerates, creating a dizzying, overwhelming tunnel of information. The parallax effect makes the headlines in the foreground zip by at high speed, while those further away move slower, creating a deep sense of media obsession.

7. (63.60 - 78.80) - Mulally's **3D silhouette** stands on a cliff edge, looking through binoculars. His point-of-view shot reveals the Microsoft board structure as a literal snake pit. Two giant, shadowy silhouettes labeled "GATES" and "BALLMER" loom over the pit, manipulating the smaller board member silhouettes like puppets on strings. Mulally's silhouette lowers the binoculars, shakes his head, and turns his back, walking calmly away from the cliff edge. The parallax shows the cliff in the foreground, the snake pit in the mid-ground, and the looming puppet masters in the distant background.

8. (79.70 - 89.76) - The searchlights from the globe scene reappear, but now when they land on different **2D silhouettes** representing candidates, the silhouettes throw up their hands and vanish in a puff of smoke. The scene then dissolves to a single, ornate goblet—a poisoned chalice—on a pedestal in a dark room. It's filled with a bubbling, toxic green liquid. The Microsoft logo is etched onto its side. Parallax is achieved as wisps of green smoke rise from the chalice in the foreground.

9. (90.48 - 106.74) - The camera zooms into a schematic of the Microsoft campus, moving past chaotic, red-alert sections ("MOBILE," "CONSUMER") before settling on a serene, blue-glowing area labeled "CLOUD & ENTERPRISE." Here, a calm, thoughtful **3D silhouette** (Nadella) acts as a conductor. He gracefully gestures as streams of glowing data flow from servers into a massive, stable cloud formation above him. A counter in the corner of the screen showing "AZURE REVENUE" ticks up at an incredible speed. The parallax shows the data streams closest to the camera moving faster.

10. (107.40 - 117.28) - A split screen. On the left, Ballmer's loud silhouette pounds a table, with aggressive, jagged sales charts exploding behind him. On the right, Nadella's quiet silhouette sits with a group of developer silhouettes, listening intently. Lines of clean, elegant code flow from their heads towards a central project. The dividing line between the two scenes slides to the left, pushing the Ballmer image off-screen, leaving only Nadella's collaborative and calm scene.

11. (118.00 - 129.42) - The boardroom. The board silhouettes are now looking at a portrait of Nadella's silhouette. The portrait is in a thick, padded, safe-looking frame. The word "SAFE" is stamped on it, then a second stamp slams down, adding "TOO?" before the whole thing morphs into a giant question mark. The camera zooms into the dot of the question mark, which transitions to the tangled pipe structure of Microsoft on a surgical table, with the Nadella silhouette standing beside it, simply observing.

12. (130.16 - 140.38) - A calendar showing "AUGUST 2013" hangs on a wall. One by one, pages for September, October, November, December, and January are torn off in a dramatic, slow-motion sequence, crumbling into dust as they fall. Through the calendar, a ghostly image of the "old" chaotic Microsoft culture swirls, a constant, menacing presence. The parallax is created by the calendar pages falling towards the viewer, with the swirling image and anxious board members visible behind them.

13. (140.92 - 149.64) - A wide shot of a colossal, featureless giant made of glass, labeled "MICROSOFT," adrift and motionless in a grey, empty limbo. The camera pans up to its head, where the boardroom is located. Inside, the frantic **3D board member silhouettes** are holding up a single, glowing crown. They desperately look left and right, offering it to the empty space around them, finding no one to take it. The parallax effect shows the giant's vast body in the far distance, creating a profound sense of scale and inaction.
