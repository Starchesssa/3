1.(0.00-9.84)- A 3D male silhouette, representing Steve Ballmer, stands at a podium stepping away from the microphone. Behind him, on a large screen, a downward-trending graph is displayed next to a cracked smartphone icon, symbolizing the Nokia disaster. In the background, a massive, stylized ship labeled "MICROSOFT" is shown drifting aimlessly in a stormy sea.

2.(10.48-17.60)- An empty, ornate CEO chair is illuminated by a single spotlight on a stage. In the foreground and background, blurred 2D male silhouettes are running around chaotically under circus tent lighting, juggling papers and creating a sense of frantic, disorganized activity.

3.(18.30-25.32)- A long boardroom table is shown with several 3D male silhouettes in a state of panic. One central silhouette has his head in his hands, while others gesture wildly. On the wall behind them, a complex and tangled flowchart representing the company has a single, glowing red button at the end labeled "RADICAL CHANGE".

4.(25.50-36.84)- Using a parallax effect, a 2D silhouette of a board member is seen inside a glass box filled with a green, toxic-looking haze. The silhouette is looking out through a telescope at a clean, bright 3D silhouette standing on a distant, pristine hill, representing the desired "outsider."

5.(37.46-51.46)- A confident 3D male silhouette, representing Alan Mulally, stands center stage like a rock star. Behind him is a split image: on one side, a crumbling factory with a "BANKRUPTCY" sign, and on the other, a gleaming, modern factory with an upward-pointing arrow and a stylized car logo.

6.(52.00-62.84)- A close-up on a stack of newspapers in the foreground. The headlines all read "MULALLY TO MICROSOFT?" and "FORD'S SAVIOR TAKES OVER?". In the background, out of focus, a 3D male silhouette holds a large broom and is sweeping dust out of a stylized building with the Microsoft logo on it.

7.(63.60-78.80)- A 3D male silhouette (Mulally) stands at the edge of a deep pit filled with writhing, stylized snakes. On the other side of the pit is a CEO's throne, but two other powerful-looking silhouettes (representing Gates and Ballmer) stand beside it, casting long, imposing shadows. The first silhouette is turning his back to walk away.

8.(79.70-89.76)- A group of 2D male silhouettes, representing the search committee, are standing together on a giant chessboard square labeled "SQUARE ONE". In front of them, on a pedestal, sits an ornate, golden chalice from which a sinister green vapor rises, representing the "poisoned chalice."

9.(90.48-99.42)- Inside the dark, complex architecture of a computer server room, one 3D male silhouette (Satya Nadella) glows with a soft, blue light. Digital lines of light from all over the room are converging on him, symbolizing his name being repeatedly recommended from within the company.

10.(99.94-110.46)- A split-screen image with a parallax effect. On the left, an aggressive 3D silhouette is on a stage, pounding a table under harsh lighting. On the right, a calm, thoughtful 3D silhouette (Nadella) stands serenely among floating, glowing cloud icons and data streams.

11.(110.86-117.28)- A 3D male silhouette (Nadella) is shown sitting at a table, leaning forward in an empathetic, listening posture. Another silhouette across from him is speaking, and instead of words, glowing lines of computer code (`< > /`) are floating from the speaker towards the listener's ear.

12.(118.00-129.42)- A group of 3D silhouettes (the board) look on with concern at another silhouette (Nadella) who is enclosed in a transparent bubble labeled "SAFE". In the midground, a large, ailing machine labeled "MICROSOFT" sits next to a tray of surgical tools, implying a radical operation is needed.

13.(130.16-140.38)- A 2D male silhouette is seen trying to climb a corporate ladder that is twisted into a circle, leading back to its own base. The ladder is cracked and crumbling, representing a "broken culture." In the background, a wall calendar has five entire months crossed out with a red 'X'.

14.(140.92-149.64)- Using a parallax effect, a massive, slumped "leaderless giant" silhouette sits in the background with puppet strings hanging loosely from its limbs. In the foreground, a group of smaller silhouettes (the board) are on their knees, desperately offering a crown to a distant, hesitant silhouette who is half-turning away.
