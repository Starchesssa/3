1. (0.00 - 9.84) - a geometric vector illustration style of a middle-aged, heavy-set male silhouette in a suit, head bowed in defeat, walking away from an empty CEO chair in a dark, panoramic office. In the background on a large screen, a shattered phone icon with the word 'NOKIA' is displayed next to a falling stock chart, creating a parallax effect.

2. (9.84 - 17.60) - a geometric vector illustration style of several male silhouettes in business suits frantically running in circles inside a circus tent. They are all chasing a glowing crown with a Microsoft logo on it. The environment is a chaotic blend of a boardroom and a circus, with the word 'CIRCUS' in large letters on the wall in a dynamic parallax view.

3. (17.60 - 25.32) - a geometric vector illustration style of a group of older male silhouettes in suits showing panicked poses around a boardroom table. One silhouette, the chairman, stands and points urgently towards a distant, glowing door. Behind them, the words 'RADICAL CHANGE' are projected onto the wall, with a stormy cityscape visible through a large window in parallax.

4. (25.32 - 36.84) - a geometric vector illustration style of male silhouettes in suits peering out from a dark, thorny room. They look through binoculars towards a single, clean path leading into a bright horizon. On the dark wall behind them, the words 'TOXIC CULTURE' are faintly visible, all in a deep parallax perspective.

5. (36.84 - 55.64) - a geometric vector illustration style of a confident older male silhouette in a sharp suit standing like a rock star on a pedestal, holding a broom. In the background, a large, shining Ford logo is visible on a wall. The words 'ROCK STAR' appear in neon lights above him, with a parallax effect showing a path from wreckage to success.

6. (55.64 - 78.80) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male silhouette in a suit standing at the edge of a dark chasm, holding up a hand in refusal. Inside the chasm, two shadowy, king-like silhouettes sit on thrones surrounded by snakes, with the words 'SNAKE PIT' etched into the rock face. The scene has a deep parallax effect, emphasizing the danger.

7. (78.80 - 89.76) - a geometric vector illustration style of dejected male silhouettes in suits standing around an empty throne. One silhouette holds out a glowing goblet with a Microsoft logo, from which ominous green smoke rises. On the throne, the words 'POISONED CHALICE' are engraved. The background shows a long, empty hall creating a parallax sense of rejection.

8. (89.76 - 110.46) - a geometric vector illustration style of a calm, thoughtful male silhouette in glasses and a sweater, calmly conducting an orchestra of glowing data clouds. In the distant parallax background, the large, aggressive shadow of another man (Ballmer) fades away, contrasting the two figures. The word 'CLOUD' is integrated into server racks in the scene.

9. (110.46 - 129.42) - a geometric vector illustration style of several board member silhouettes huddled together, peering doubtfully across a room at a single, calm silhouette holding a glowing scalpel. Behind the board, the words 'TOO SAFE?' are projected on the wall in a stark, questioning font, with the room's sterile architecture creating a parallax effect.

10. (129.42 - 140.38) - a geometric vector illustration style of male silhouettes trapped inside a giant, cracked hourglass, looking up with desperation as the sand trickles down slowly. The words 'FIVE MONTHS' are etched on the glass, creating a feeling of being stuck in time with a parallax view of the world rushing by outside.

11. (140.38 - 149.64) - a geometric vector illustration style of a colossal, headless silhouette of a man in a suit sitting slumped in a foggy void, representing a 'LEADERLESS GIANT'. Tiny silhouettes at its feet desperately try to offer a glowing crown to figures in the distance who are all walking away, creating a deep parallax scene of rejection and limbo.
