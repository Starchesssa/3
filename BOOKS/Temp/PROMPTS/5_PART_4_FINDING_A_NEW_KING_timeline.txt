1.(0.00-9.84)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an angular, featureless black head in a suit, slumping his shoulders as he walks away from a towering, sharp-edged throne in a dark, parallax environment.

2.(9.84-17.60)- a geometric vector illustration style of several characters with angular, featureless black heads in suits, running chaotically in different directions under a stylized circus tent, creating a sense of frantic panic in a parallax setting.

3.(17.60-25.32)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an angular, featureless black head, standing before a massive, sparking control panel with his hands thrown up in panic, set in a dark, glitching control room with a deep parallax effect.

4.(25.32-36.84)- a geometric vector illustration style of a group of characters with angular, featureless black heads, turning their backs on a dark, thorny structure as they look through a large telescope towards a distant, bright star in a parallax view.

5.(36.84-51.46)- a geometric vector illustration style of a heroic character with an angular, featureless black head, standing confidently on a mountain peak as lines of light emanate from him to rebuild a structure in the valley below, viewed in parallax.

6.(51.46-62.84)- a geometric vector illustration style of a massive silhouette of a character projected onto a skyscraper, while a crowd of smaller figures below points glowing devices upwards in a media frenzy, creating a dynamic parallax scene.

7.(62.84-78.80)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an angular, featureless black head standing at the edge of a pit, holding up a hand to refuse entry to two thrones entangled by sharp, geometric snakes within a deep parallax cavern.

8.(78.80-89.76)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an angular, featureless black head recoiling in horror from another figure offering a glowing, "poisoned" chalice in a grand, decaying hall with a parallax background.

9.(89.76-106.74)- a geometric vector illustration style of a calm character with an angular, featureless black head, thoughtfully tending to a glowing, intricate network of light representing the cloud in a serene, geometric data garden with a parallax depth.

10.(106.74-117.28)- a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an angular, featureless black head sitting calmly, listening to a floating cube of code, while the aggressive shadow of another figure is cast on the wall behind him in stark parallax contrast.

11.(117.28-129.42)- a geometric vector illustration style of skeptical characters with angular, featureless black heads looking down from a high gallery as a lone figure below holds a delicate surgical tool, creating a questioning atmosphere in a deep parallax perspective.

12.(129.42-149.64)- a geometric vector illustration style of a colossal, headless giant slumped in a vast, grey void, while tiny, panicked figures run around on its shoulders with spyglasses, creating an immense sense of scale in a parallax setting.
