1. (0.00 - 9.84) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette character with an angular head, shoulders slumped in defeat, walking away from a massive, imposing throne that is cracking apart, all in parallax.
2. (9.84 - 17.60) - a geometric vector illustration style of several 3D silhouette characters with angular heads running in a frantic circle under a single spotlight, creating a chaotic circus-like scene, all in parallax.
3. (17.60 - 29.30) - a geometric vector illustration style of a group of 3D silhouette characters with angular heads huddled together in panic, looking at a large, broken, glitching machine in a dark, abstract boardroom, all in parallax.
4. (29.30 - 42.44) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette character with an angular head standing inside a dark, oppressive maze of thorns, looking out through a single opening towards a bright, clean horizon, all in parallax.
5. (42.44 - 55.64) - a geometric vector illustration style of a heroic 3D silhouette character with an angular head standing confidently on a pedestal, bathed in a spotlight as a crumbling factory is rebuilt behind him, all in parallax.
6. (55.64 - 78.80) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette character with an angular head standing at the edge of a dark pit filled with geometric snakes, holding up a hand to refuse entry to two figures on thrones on the other side, all in parallax.
7. (78.80 - 89.76) - a geometric vector illustration style of a dejected 3D silhouette character with an angular head on its knees, offering a glowing chalice from which a toxic green vapor rises into an empty, dark void, all in parallax.
8. (89.76 - 106.74) - a geometric vector illustration style of a calm 3D silhouette character with an angular head tending to a bright, glowing, growing structure representing the cloud, pushing back the surrounding darkness in a server room, all in parallax.
9. (106.74 - 117.28) - a geometric vector illustration style of two 3D silhouette characters with angular heads back-to-back; one is in a loud, shouting pose, while the other is in a quiet, contemplative pose, looking at floating lines of code, all in parallax.
10. (117.28 - 129.42) - a geometric vector illustration style of several large, looming 3D silhouette figures with angular heads scrutinizing a smaller figure, handing him a glowing scalpel with hesitant poses, all in parallax.
11. (129.42 - 140.38) - a geometric vector illustration style of anxious 3D silhouette characters with angular heads trapped inside a giant, transparent hourglass, as sand made of broken geometric pieces falls on them, all in parallax.
12. (140.38 - 149.64) - a geometric vector illustration style of a colossal, stumbling 3D silhouette giant made of disjointed blocks, with tiny, frantic figures on its shoulders looking through telescopes into a stormy sky, all in parallax.
