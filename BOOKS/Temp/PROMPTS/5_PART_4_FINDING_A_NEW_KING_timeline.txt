1.(0.00-9.84)- A 3D male silhouette, representing Steve Ballmer, stands on a large, dimly lit stage, his back partially turned to the viewer. In the vast, dark background, a massive screen displays a declining stock chart with a faint, blurred Nokia logo. The parallax effect creates depth between the lone figure on the stage and the troubling data on the screen behind him, capturing a moment of resignation.

2.(9.84-17.60)- A shot of a modern, high-tech boardroom table. Several 2D male silhouettes are seated around it in animated discussion. From the center of the table, a holographic carousel of faceless silhouette headshots spins rapidly, symbolizing the frantic and chaotic "circus" of the CEO search. The parallax effect makes the holographic display feel separate from the silhouettes and the city skyline visible through the window.

3.(17.60-25.32)- A dramatic close-up on a 3D silhouette's hand nervously tapping a pen against a polished boardroom table. In the blurred background, other silhouettes are seen in tense, agitated postures. Scattered papers on the table show charts with sharp downward trends, conveying a sense of panic. The parallax effect emphasizes the foreground anxiety against the backdrop of the worried board.

4.(25.32-36.84)- A view from inside a glass-walled office looking out. A single silhouette stands, examining a complex, messy flowchart on a whiteboard labeled "Company Culture." Through the glass, other distinct silhouettes representing outside candidates walk down a brightly lit hallway, creating a stark visual divide between the internal "toxic" environment and the external search. Parallax is used to separate the interior office from the external hallway.

5.(36.84-51.46)- A stylized image featuring the silhouette of a confident man, representing Alan Mulally, standing in a spotlight. To his left, a sleek graphic shows the Ford logo next to a sharply rising stock graph. In the distant, darker background, the Microsoft logo waits, positioning him as a potential savior. The parallax effect gives depth between the foreground graphics and the background logo.

6.(51.46-58.42)- A 3D silhouette sits in a dark office, illuminated only by the glow from multiple computer monitors in front of him. Each screen is filled with stylized, overlapping news headlines: "MULALLY THE FAVORITE FOR MICROSOFT," "FORD'S CHIEF TO REDMOND?" The image is a visual cacophony of media speculation. The parallax effect creates layers of depth among the different screens.

7.(58.42-78.80)- A 2D silhouette, representing Mulally, stands at the threshold of a dark, intimidating boardroom, pausing before entering. Inside, two other powerful silhouettes (representing Gates and Ballmer) cast long, distorted shadows across the room, creating a visual "snake pit." The figure at the door is shown subtly turning away, rejecting the scene. The parallax effect enhances the daunting depth of the room.

8.(78.80-89.76)- A high-angle shot looking down at a single, empty CEO's chair in a vast, dark boardroom. A single spotlight illuminates the chair and the desk, upon which sits a stylized, glowing chalice that gives off a faintly ominous aura. The parallax effect, showing dust motes floating in the light beam, emphasizes the loneliness and undesirability of the "poisoned chalice."

9.(89.76-106.74)- An image split into two scenes. On the left, a chaotic boardroom with arguing silhouettes. On the right, a single, calm silhouette of an engineer (Satya Nadella) stands in a cool-toned, orderly server room. Lines of light representing data flow from the server racks and swirl around him, illustrating his command of the successful cloud division. The parallax effect is seen in the layers of server racks stretching into the background.

10.(106.74-117.28)- A close-up side profile of a 3D silhouette (Nadella) listening with a thoughtful, empathetic posture to another person. In the foreground, a computer monitor with lines of code is visible but out of focus. In the far background, a faint, ghosted image of a different silhouette in a loud, table-pounding pose (representing Ballmer) provides a stark contrast. The parallax effect separates these three layers: code, conversation, and past leadership style.

11.(117.28-129.42)- A group of board member silhouettes huddle on one side of a wide room, looking across at a single, distant silhouette of Nadella. Hanging in the air between them is a large, translucent question mark. The word "SAFE?" is faintly projected on the wall behind Nadella, visualizing the board's doubt. Parallax effect creates a sense of vast distance and uncertainty between the board and their potential choice.

12.(129.42-140.38)- A shot focusing on a calendar on an office wall. The pages for August, September, October, and so on, are peeling off and falling away, symbolizing the agonizing passage of time. Through a window in the background, the silhouettes of the board can be seen in a continuous, weary meeting. The parallax effect of the falling pages against the static background scene highlights the frustratingly long search.

13.(140.38-149.64)- A dramatic, wide shot of a massive, darkened corporate campus building at dusk, representing the "leaderless giant." Only one window is illuminated high up—the boardroom where the desperate search continues. The silhouette of the board can be seen inside. The parallax effect of clouds moving slowly across the sky behind the static building enhances the feeling of a company in limbo.
