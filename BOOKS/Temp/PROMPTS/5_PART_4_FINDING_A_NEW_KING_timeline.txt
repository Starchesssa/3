1.(0.00-9.84)- a geometric vector illustration style of a middle-aged silhouette in a sharp suit, his angular head bowed in defeat, walking away from a CEO's desk. In the parallax background, a large, fractured 'NOKIA' logo looms over a plunging stock chart, with sharp geometric shards floating in the air.

2.(10.48-17.60)- a geometric vector illustration style of several silhouettes in sharp business suits running frantically in circles inside a stylized, angular circus tent. In the center, a spotlight shines on an empty, throne-like CEO chair with a geometric 'MICROSOFT' logo on it, creating a parallax effect.

3.(18.30-25.32)- a geometric vector illustration style of a lead silhouette in a chairman's suit, clutching his angular head in panic, surrounded by other frantic board member silhouettes in a stark boardroom. On the parallax background wall, the words 'RADICAL CHANGE' are displayed in a large, glitchy, angular font.

4.(25.50-36.84)- a geometric vector illustration style of a silhouette in a suit standing at a crossroads, looking towards a clean, bright horizon. Behind him, a dark, angular, thorny thicket representing 'TOXIC CULTURE' with a faint green glow. The parallax background features a vast, minimalist sky with the single word 'OUTSIDER' floating.

5.(37.46-55.64)- a geometric vector illustration style of a confident, heroic silhouette of an older executive in a sharp suit, posing like a rock star with one foot on a pile of angular debris. In the parallax background, the clean, glowing 'FORD' logo contrasts with a dark, messy, stylized Microsoft office space he is about to clean.

6.(56.04-62.84)- a geometric vector illustration style of a central executive silhouette walking forward, bombarded by an abstract storm of sharp, geometric shapes representing camera flashes and microphones. The parallax background is a collage of stylized newspaper headlines, with the words 'MULALI' and 'MICROSOFT' prominently and repeatedly visible.

7.(63.60-78.80)- a geometric vector illustration style of a single executive silhouette standing at the edge of a dark chasm, holding up a hand to refuse entry. Inside the chasm, which forms a parallax background, two other powerful silhouettes sit on thrones amidst abstract, geometric shapes representing a 'SNAKE PIT'.

8.(79.70-89.76)- a geometric vector illustration style of a group of executive silhouettes recoiling in fear from another silhouette who is offering a glowing, ornate goblet. The goblet, etched with a subtle Microsoft logo, emits a toxic green light. The parallax background is a grand, shadowy hall with the words 'POISONED CHALICE' inscribed on a far wall.

9.(90.48-106.74)- a geometric vector illustration style of a quiet, thoughtful silhouette of an engineer in a business-casual shirt, standing calmly amidst a complex, glowing network of data streams. In the parallax background, a massive, stable, geometric cloud icon pulses with light, symbolizing the successful 'CLOUD' division.

10.(107.40-117.28)- a geometric vector illustration style of a split scene showing a stark contrast between two executive silhouettes. On one side, a large, aggressive silhouette pounds a table. On the other, a calmer silhouette leans in, listening empathetically to a group of engineers. The parallax background is divided, with abstract 'CODE' flowing on one side and jarring 'SALES' charts on the other.

11.(118.00-129.42)- a geometric vector illustration style of a group of board member silhouettes huddled together, whispering and pointing doubtfully at a single, calm silhouette of an engineer holding a small, precise scalpel. The engineer stands before a large, fractured Microsoft logo on an operating table, with a giant, glowing question mark in the parallax background.

12.(130.16-140.38)- a geometric vector illustration style of a lone executive silhouette walking endlessly on a circular path inside a giant, cracked hourglass where sand slowly falls. Faintly etched on the glass are the words 'BROKEN CULTURE'. The parallax background shows a stark calendar with five months agonizingly crossed out.

13.(140.92-149.64)- a geometric vector illustration style of a colossal, headless silhouette of a business giant slumping over a stylized city skyline, representing a 'LEADERLESS' company. On a rooftop below, tiny board member silhouettes are on their knees, looking up desperately. The parallax background is a vast, empty sky with the faint word 'SAVIOR?'.
