1. (0.00-9.84) - A broad-shouldered silhouette in a suit turns his back on a massive, ornate CEO chair. His head is slightly bowed in defeat as glitching screens showing the Nokia logo and crashing stock charts illuminate a dark, stormy corporate office.

2. (10.48-17.60) - A single, glowing CEO chair sits empty under a harsh spotlight in the center of a dark circus ring. The ring is surrounded by the aggressive silhouettes of a crowd, all holding up glowing phones, their posture creating a sense of chaotic frenzy.

3. (18.30-29.30) - In a dark, high-tech boardroom, several silhouettes in suits hunch over a holographic globe, pointing frantically. Their panicked, stressed gestures cast long shadows as they desperately search for a solution. Fog swirls around their feet.

4. (29.96-36.84) - A lone, sharp silhouette stands on a clean, minimalist precipice, looking across a chasm at a distant city skyline made of tangled, glowing green circuits representing a "toxic" culture. The silhouette's posture is upright and separate, completely untainted.

5. (37.46-55.64) - A confident, heroic silhouette stands on an elevated platform, hands on hips like a rock star, looking down. Below him is a messy, chaotic landscape of broken servers and tangled wires, waiting for him to "clean house."

6. (56.04-78.80) - A silhouette stands at the edge of a pit filled with writhing snakes made of green code. He holds a hand up in a clear "no thanks" gesture, turning away from a CEO throne on the other side, which is flanked by two huge, looming, king-like shadows.

7. (79.70-89.76) - In the center of a vast, dark hall, a single ornate chalice glows with a sickly green light, emitting toxic smoke. In the foreground, numerous silhouettes in suits are seen walking away, their backs turned to the "poisoned" opportunity.

8. (90.48-110.46) - A calm, slender silhouette in an open-collared shirt stands thoughtfully, looking over a vast, orderly server farm glowing with a cool blue light. He is the quiet center of a massive, successful operation, a stark contrast to the chaos before.

9. (110.86-129.42) - Several board member silhouettes whisper and gesture with doubt as they look upon a single, quiet silhouette holding a glowing line of code like a surgeon's scalpel. They are in a sterile operating room, with a giant, broken Microsoft logo lying on the table between them.

10. (130.16-149.64) - A massive, giant silhouette of a businessman sits slumped on a throne in a desolate wasteland. Its head is a swirling, glitching question mark, symbolizing a "leaderless giant" in limbo as calendar pages blow past in an agonizing whirlwind.
