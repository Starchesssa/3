1. (0.00-9.84) - A 3D angular figure in a defeated pose, walking away from a massive, empty CEO throne. The background is a vast, dark corporate hall with a glitching screen displaying a falling phone icon, all in parallax.

2. (10.48-17.60) - Several 3D angular figures running frantically in a circle under a harsh spotlight. The environment is a dark, minimalist circus ring with floating geometric question marks, all in parallax.

3. (18.30-29.30) - A leading 3D angular figure on a high-tech balcony, anxiously peering through holographic binoculars into a vast digital void. Other figures huddle behind him in fear, all in parallax.

4. (29.96-36.84) - A sharp, geometric hand reaches out from a cage of tangled red neon lines towards a lone, clean figure standing in a void. The contrast between the chaotic interior and the calm exterior is emphasized by parallax.

5. (37.46-55.64) - A single, heroic 3D angular figure stands confidently atop a pile of scrap metal, holding a glowing geometric tool. A massive, dark corporate monolith looms in the distant background, all in parallax.

6. (56.04-78.80) - A 3D angular figure at a doorway, holding up a hand to refuse entry into a dark throne room. Inside, two shadowy figures on thrones cast long, snake-like shadows on the floor, all in parallax.

7. (79.70-89.76) - Dejected 3D angular figures recoil from a glowing, ornate chalice emitting toxic green smoke on a pedestal. The scene is in a vast, dark hall, with the chalice as the only light source, all in parallax.

8. (90.48-110.46) - A calm 3D angular figure kneels, thoughtfully tending to a glowing, growing network of light on the floor of a vast digital server garden, all in parallax.

9. (110.86-129.42) - A calm 3D angular figure stands in the center of a sterile room while giant, shadowy figures loom over him, scrutinizing him with beams of light, all in parallax.

10. (130.16-149.64) - A colossal, headless geometric titan sits slumped amidst a rainy cyberpunk cityscape. Tiny angular figures run frantically on its shoulders, trying to attach a new head, all in parallax.
