**7.96 --> 9.22: CEO of Microsoft.**
A stark, official announcement on a news website. The headline is bold and centered: **"SATYA NADELLA NAMED CEO OF MICROSOFT."** The iconic Microsoft logo is beside it. The rest of the page is slightly out of focus.

**9.94 --> 12.20: The entire tech world held its breath.**
A dynamic montage of different scenes:
- A packed stock exchange floor, traders frozen, looking up at the ticker boards.
- A coffee shop in Silicon Valley, where everyone has stopped talking and is staring at their glowing laptops and phones.
- A world map with data lines and social media icons pulsing rapidly, then suddenly stopping in unison. The globe is cast in a tense, blue light.

**12.74 --> 14.54: Was this the guy? Really?**
A rapid-fire sequence of skeptical social media posts and news headlines flashing on screen. Text like: "Who is Satya?", "An Insider? Risky Move.", "UNEXPECTED", and a collage of question marks superimposed over a generic corporate photo of Satya Nadella.

**15.00 --> 16.20: The quiet engineer?**
A stark visual contrast. A shot of an empty, massive, brightly lit stage meant for a charismatic CEO, then a quick cut to a quiet, dimly lit office. We see the silhouette of a man (Nadella) from behind, focused intently on complex code flowing down a computer monitor. His glasses reflect the lines of code.

**16.86 --> 17.98: His first act as...**
Close-up shot of a hand turning a new, blank page in a notebook. The camera then pulls back to show Satya Nadella, now in focus and looking determined, standing in front of a giant whiteboard, holding a marker, ready to write. The whiteboard is clean, representing a fresh start.
