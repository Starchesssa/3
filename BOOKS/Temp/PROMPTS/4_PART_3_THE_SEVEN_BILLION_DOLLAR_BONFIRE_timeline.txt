1.  **(0.00-9.79) - visual description**
    A stark, wide shot of the modern, glass-paneled Microsoft campus at dusk. A massive **2D male silhouette**, representing Steve Ballmer, looms over the buildings. As the camera slowly pulls back, his distorted shadow stretches across the ground, morphing into the shape of a classic, crumbling Nokia brick phone. **Parallax effect:** The silhouette in the mid-ground moves slightly faster than the distant campus buildings, creating a sense of imposing scale.

2.  **(9.79-15.79) - visual description**
    Cut to a dark, cavernous warehouse. In the center, a colossal pile of cash stands taller than a person. A single **3D male silhouette** walks up, strikes a match in slow motion, and casually tosses it onto the pile. The money erupts into a roaring bonfire. Glowing, fiery embers float slowly towards the camera in the foreground. A bold, white text graphic slams onto the screen: **$7,200,000,000**. **Parallax effect:** The floating embers in the foreground drift upwards, contrasting with the slower, more stable shot of the fire and silhouette in the background.

3.  **(16.30-24.72) - visual description**
    A split-screen. On the left, a minimalist animated graph shows the "Windows Phone" market share as a pathetically small, flickering bar. On the right, the Apple and Android logos are depicted as enormous, solid fortresses. A glowing blue wireframe hand (Microsoft) desperately reaches from the left screen, grabs a stylized 3D model of a Nokia factory from the right, and violently yanks it over to its side. **Parallax effect:** A background layer of scrolling, blurred app icons moves slowly behind the main action, giving depth to the graphic.

4.  **(24.72-33.40) - visual description**
    An animated cross-section of a **2D silhouette's head**. Inside, two glowing puzzle pieces are seen. One is labeled "HARDWARE," the other "SOFTWARE." They float towards each other and click together with a satisfying snap. The combined piece then morphs into a perfect, gleaming apple logo that pulses with light. **Parallax effect:** The camera pushes into the animated brain, with glowing neural pathways firing and moving in the background at a different speed than the puzzle pieces in the foreground.

5.  **(34.02-41.68) - visual description**
    A hyper-stylized shot of two **3D male silhouettes** in a dark boardroom, shaking hands over a contract that glows with an ominous red light. The instant their hands meet, the document bursts into digital flames, and animated cracks of lightning shoot across the table. The on-screen text appears: **STRATEGIC MOVE [strə-ˈtē-jik ˈmüv] noun: The dumbest of the decade.** **Parallax effect:** The camera slowly pushes in on the burning contract, making the silhouettes and the dark room blur and recede into the background.

6.  **(42.20-53.50) - visual description**
    A metaphorical scene in dark, choppy digital water. Two **3D male silhouettes**, one with a pixelated Microsoft logo on its back and the other with a Nokia logo, are shackled together at the wrist. They struggle futilely, their movements pulling each other under the surface. **Parallax effect:** The camera is positioned low, half-submerged, with water droplets on the lens in the extreme foreground. The choppy waves in the mid-ground move erratically, while a distant, dark horizon remains almost static.

7.  **(53.50-61.84) - visual description**
    Inside a stylized, long, dark Microsoft boardroom. On one side of the table, a dozen **2D male silhouettes** sit with their arms crossed, shaking their heads in dissent. A prominent silhouette among them (representing Bill Gates) has a large, animated red 'X' flashing over him. On the far side, a single, imposing **2D silhouette** (Ballmer) stands alone, animated to look like he's shouting, though no sound is heard. **Parallax effect:** The background shows a large window with a blurred, rainy cityscape; raindrops streak down the glass in the foreground, moving faster than the city lights behind them.

8.  **(62.28-72.76) - visual description**
    A **3D silhouette** (Nadella) stands in a digital "war room" before a massive holographic map of the mobile market. The territories for Apple and Google are vast, glowing continents. The Microsoft territory is a tiny, flickering island. As animated dollar signs are shoveled into the island, causing it to smoke, the silhouette decisively turns his back on the map and walks away. **Parallax effect:** The holographic map has multiple layers of data and grids that scroll at different speeds, creating a deep, complex visual as the silhouette walks towards the camera.

9.  **(73.34-81.56) - visual description**
    A stylized World War I trench. **2D silhouettes** wearing helmets with the Windows logo huddle down as an overwhelming barrage of Apple and Android logos fall from the sky like cartoon bombs, exploding in flashes of light. A pop-up graphic in the corner shows a heart meter labeled "CONSUMER AFFECTION" which is completely empty. **Parallax effect:** Animated smoke and digital debris drift across the foreground, while the enemy logos fall from the sky in the background.

10. **(81.56-94.28) - visual description**
    Two abstract forces collide in dramatic slow motion. One is a liquid, blue mass formed of shifting lines of binary code, labeled "MICROSOFT." It crashes headfirst into a solid, metallic entity made of interlocking gears and circuits with a subtle Finnish flag color scheme, labeled "NOKIA." The impact sends broken gears and corrupted code flying everywhere. **Parallax effect:** The background is a simple grid that warps and ripples violently at the point of impact, while the flying debris moves quickly past the camera in the foreground.

11. **(94.90-101.20) - visual description**
    A chaotic, stylized office environment. On a central table, a blueprint for a "New Phone" is being pulled in opposite directions by two teams of arguing **2D silhouettes** until it tears in half. In the background, a digital project timeline on a screen shows progress bars glitching and dates constantly being pushed back. **Parallax effect:** Post-it notes with frantic scribbles and question marks float slowly across the foreground, out of focus, adding to the sense of confusion.

12. **(101.20-111.84) - visual description**
    An old-fashioned stock ticker machine furiously spits out a long strip of paper. The camera follows the paper as it cascades onto the floor. Instead of stock prices, the paper is printed with one word over and over: "NOTHING." In the background, a large digital bar graph labeled "MARKET SHARE" shows the red "Windows Phone" bar shrinking until it's barely visible. **Parallax effect:** The ticker tape in the foreground fills the screen while the graph in the background slowly animates downward.

13. **(112.46-122.04) - visual description**
    A line of identical **3D male silhouettes** stand on a conveyor belt leading to a giant, roaring furnace with the Windows Phone logo embossed on its door. Each silhouette mechanically shovels a huge stack of cash into the furnace's open maw. The camera pans back to reveal the conveyor belt stretches into infinity. On-screen text appears: **SUNK COST FALLACY [səŋk ˈkȯst ˈfa-lə-sē]: Throwing good money after bad.** **Parallax effect:** The intense heat haze from the furnace in the mid-ground visibly distorts the endless line of silhouettes stretching into the background.

14. **(122.50-139.16) - visual description**
    The final scene. A lone, defiant **3D male silhouette** (Ballmer) stands atop a huge, crumbling mountain made of discarded Nokia phones and bundles of cash. The mountain visibly shakes and sheds debris. In the background, the iconic Microsoft logo on a distant building has animated red lines dripping from it like blood. A "COMPANY MORALE" gauge in the corner of the screen plummets into the red zone. **Parallax effect:** Dust and loose dollar bills from the crumbling mountain drift down in the foreground, obscuring the view of the failing peak.
