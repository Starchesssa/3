1. (0.00-9.79) - A lone 3D male silhouette, representing Steve Ballmer, stands dwarfed in the center of a vast, dark server room. The camera slowly dollies left.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** In the foreground, rows of server racks with blinking blue lights slide past quickly. In the background, distant, out-of-focus server racks fade into an abyss, with the words "NOKIA'S PHONE BUSINESS" faintly stenciled on a far wall like a cryptic warning.

2. (9.79-15.78) - A stylized, slow-motion shot of a massive bonfire inside a cavernous, industrial furnace. Instead of wood, the fire is fueled by huge stacks of glowing green cash blocks.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** In the foreground, bright embers and glowing dollar sign particles float towards the camera. In the midground, the roaring furnace has "$7.2 BILLION BONFIRE" stenciled on its side. In the background, the dark, shadowy architecture of the factory is visible.

3. (15.78-25.58) - A dramatic scene showing two crumbling, concrete platforms separated by a dark chasm. A 3D silhouette of an executive makes a desperate leap from a platform labeled "WINDOWS PHONE RELEVANCE" towards the other platform labeled "NOKIA."
    *   **Parallax Effect:** Chunks of concrete and dust from the crumbling "WINDOWS" platform fall past in the foreground. In the background, the chasm appears bottomless, filled with a dark fog. The year "2013" is projected onto the leaping silhouette.

4. (25.58-37.46) - A stylized blueprint animation. A silhouette of an executive forcefully tries to jam two incompatible gears together. One gear is made of blue, glowing circuit patterns labeled "SOFTWARE," and the other is a heavy, metallic gear labeled "HARDWARE."
    *   **Parallax Effect:** Blueprint grid lines and technical annotations slide across the screen in the foreground. In the background, a perfectly meshed, sleek silver gear system labeled "APPLE" turns smoothly, bathed in a soft white light.

5. (37.46-48.30) - A close-up on a contract being signed on a dark boardroom table. As the pen lifts, the paper immediately begins to burn and disintegrate from the signature outwards, turning into black ash.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** Particles of ash float slowly upwards and towards the camera in the foreground. In the background, the blurred silhouettes of other board members watch silently from the shadows.

6. (48.30-54.72) - An underwater shot in murky, dark water. Two 3D male silhouettes are chained together at the wrist, pulling each other down. One silhouette glows with a blue Windows logo (Microsoft), the other is made of brushed metal phone casings (Nokia).
    *   **Parallax Effect:** Air bubbles and debris float up past the camera in the foreground. In the midground, the figures struggle and sink. In the background, the faint, distant light from the surface grows smaller and further away.

7. (54.72-66.78) - A dark, ominous boardroom. A long table has a jagged crack running down its center. On one side, a single, imposing silhouette stands, arguing forcefully. On the other, a group of silhouettes (including ones labeled GATES and NADELLA) sit with their arms crossed, shaking their heads.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** In the foreground, an out-of-focus water glass on the table vibrates. In the background, a large window shows a stormy cityscape with rain streaking down the glass.

8. (66.78-81.56) - A stylized WWI-style trench scene. Silhouettes of executives are in a muddy trench labeled "MOBILE MARKET." Instead of weapons, they are frantically using shovels to throw stacks of glowing green cash over the top into a dark, smoky No Man's Land.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** Mud and dollar signs are kicked up by the shovels, flying towards the foreground. In the background, the dark battlefield is lit only by explosions that look like evaporating currency symbols.

9. (81.56-96.14) - Two massive, stylized tidal waves rush towards each other, about to collide. One wave is made of glowing blue binary code (0s and 1s) and labeled "MICROSOFT CULTURE." The other is made of steel, gears, and polished metal plates, labeled "NOKIA CULTURE."
    *   **Parallax Effect:** In the foreground, sprays of binary digits and metal shards fly towards the camera. The background is a stark, empty void, focusing all attention on the imminent, violent impact.

10. (96.14-107.28) - A 3D animated bar chart showing "Mobile Market Share." Two massive bars, "iOS" and "ANDROID," tower over everything. Next to them is a tiny, flickering bar labeled "WINDOWS PHONE." As the camera zooms in, the tiny bar shrinks even further before a huge, red "ABSOLUTELY NOTHING" stamp slams down on top of it.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** Glowing grid lines and data points from the chart slide past in the foreground. The two giant bars remain static and imposing in the background.

11. (107.28-122.04) - A dark lab. A zombie-like silhouette, stitched together from old phone parts, lies on an operating table. It's hooked to an IV drip bag that is pumping glowing dollar signs into its veins. A monitor in the background shows a flatline, except for a graph labeled "CASH BURN" which is spiking off the charts.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** In the foreground, the IV tube is in sharp focus, showing the currency symbols flowing through it. The background monitors are blurred but their frantic red lines are clear.

12. (122.04-139.16) - A massive, glass Microsoft logo stands in a dark space. A huge crack runs through it. From the crack, a river of glowing dollar signs pours out onto the floor. The internal light of the logo flickers and dims, representing failing morale.
    *   **Parallax Effect:** In the foreground, the pool of glowing dollar signs on the floor spreads towards the camera. In the background, the lone silhouette of Steve Ballmer turns and walks away, disappearing into the shadows.
