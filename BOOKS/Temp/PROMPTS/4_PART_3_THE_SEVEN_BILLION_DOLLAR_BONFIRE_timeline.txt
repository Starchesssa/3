1. (0.00-9.30) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette character with an angular, featureless head, standing lost and confused before a towering, monolithic structure labeled 'NOKIA PHONES', all in parallax.
2. (9.78-15.78) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette character with an angular, featureless head, dramatically throwing stylized stacks of money into a massive, roaring bonfire of geometric flames, all in parallax.
3. (16.30-24.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of a large 3D silhouette character with a featureless angular head, making a desperate, lunging grab for a smaller object representing Nokia's phone division, all in a stark, minimalist environment in parallax.
4. (24.72-33.40) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette character with a featureless angular head, looking into a mirror and seeing a reflection of a sleeker, more successful figure marked with an apple symbol, all in parallax.
5. (34.02-41.68) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette character’s hand signing a contract that is actively disintegrating into geometric shards at the point of the pen, all in a stark boardroom setting in parallax.
6. (42.20-53.50) - a geometric vector illustration style of two 3D silhouette characters with featureless angular heads, shackled together and desperately flailing as they sink into dark, abstract water, all in parallax.
7. (53.50-61.84) - a geometric vector illustration style of a tense boardroom meeting, with one 3D silhouette character pushing a deal forward while others recoil in opposition, their poses showing clear dissent, all in parallax.
8. (62.28-72.76) - a geometric vector illustration style of a lone 3D silhouette character with a featureless angular head, standing on a precipice and looking down at a desolate battlefield of broken mobile phones, a scene of a lost war, all in parallax.
9. (73.34-81.56) - a geometric vector illustration style of a small 3D silhouette character with a featureless angular head, cowering in a trench while two massive, god-like figures loom over the battlefield, all in parallax.
10. (81.56-94.28) - a geometric vector illustration style of two opposing 3D silhouette figures, one representing software and the other hardware, colliding violently head-on, shattering into abstract shapes upon impact, all in parallax.
11. (94.90-101.20) - a geometric vector illustration style of a group of 3D silhouette characters with featureless angular heads in a chaotic office, arguing and pulling a project in opposite directions with a central empty leader's chair, all in parallax.
12. (101.20-107.28) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette character with a featureless angular head, slumped in disappointment over a massive, opened treasure chest that is completely empty, all in parallax.
13. (107.86-117.70) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette character with a featureless angular head, frantically feeding stacks of money into a large, crumbling, zombie-like machine with a downward-trending graph on its side, all in parallax.
14. (118.38-129.42) - a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette character with a featureless angular head, relentlessly shoveling money from a huge pile into a roaring furnace, trapped in a deep pit of their own making, all in parallax.
15. (129.42-139.16) - a geometric vector illustration style of a defeated 3D silhouette character with a featureless angular head, standing alone on a crumbling monument that is bleeding money and morale, a symbol of epic failure, all in parallax.
