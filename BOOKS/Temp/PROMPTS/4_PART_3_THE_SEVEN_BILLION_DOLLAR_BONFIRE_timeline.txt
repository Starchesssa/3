1.(0.00-9.30)- A lone 3D angular character stands lost and hunched over amidst a sprawling, dark cyberpunk cityscape, pointing a shaky, geometric finger towards a distant, flickering neon sign shaped like an old mobile phone, all in parallax.
2.(9.78-15.78)- A 3D angular character is on their knees, head bowed in despair, before a massive bonfire of glowing, abstract mobile phones in a rain-slicked alley, with neon dollar signs glitching in the background, all in parallax.
3.(16.30-24.72)- A 3D angular character in a sharp business suit makes a desperate lunge forward, arms outstretched to grab a crumbling geometric tower labeled 'NOKIA' as smaller structures collapse around them, all in parallax.
4.(24.72-33.40)- A single 3D angular character stands confidently, chest puffed out, holding two glowing geometric shapes (a square for software, a phone for hardware) that refuse to merge, against a backdrop of a giant, idealized neon apple logo, all in parallax.
5.(34.02-41.68)- A 3D angular character recoils in horror, hands thrown up to their featureless head, as two massive, sharp-edged corporate monoliths crash into each other, sending geometric shards flying, all in parallax.
6.(42.20-53.50)- Two 3D angular characters, shackled together at the wrist with a glowing chain, sink helplessly into a dark digital ocean, their bodies flailing as they pull each other down, all in parallax.
7.(53.50-61.84)- Inside a stark, geometric boardroom, one 3D angular character slams their fist on the table in protest while others slump in their chairs or shake their heads in disagreement, with the lead character looking away defiantly, all in parallax.
8.(62.28-72.76)- A 3D angular character stands with their back turned and arms crossed, watching as other figures futilely throw glowing cubes of data into a vast, dark chasm representing a lost war, all in parallax.
9.(73.34-81.56)- A small, 3D angular character stands alone and overwhelmed, armed with only a tiny, blunt geometric shape, facing two colossal, glowing titans representing Apple and Google on a digital battlefield, all in parallax.
10.(81.56-94.28)- Two 3D angular characters, one made of solid, blocky hardware shapes and the other of fluid, glowing software code, are depicted mid-collision, shattering into fragments at the point of impact inside a glitching corporate lobby, all in parallax.
11.(94.90-101.20)- Multiple 3D angular characters are in a state of chaos inside a disorienting, M.C. Escher-like office space, pointing accusatorily at each other and pulling in different directions as geometric project plans crumble around them, all in parallax.
12.(101.20-107.28)- A 3D angular character holds their geometric hands open, palms up, as only digital dust and glitching zeros fall into them from a massive, dark corporate machine looming above, all in parallax.
13.(107.86-117.70)- A 3D angular character frantically tries to plug leaks in a massive, transparent tank filled with glowing liquid currency, as the liquid level plummets and drains away into the dark city below, all in parallax.
14.(118.38-129.42)- A 3D angular character, with a look of desperate obsession, is shown relentlessly shoveling glowing data cubes into a giant, roaring furnace with the Microsoft logo etched on its side, all in parallax.
15.(129.42-139.16)- A single 3D angular character, representing Balmer, stands defeated atop a crumbling, glitching pedestal, their sharp-shouldered suit tattered as the massive corporate structure behind them bleeds neon light and data, all in parallax.
