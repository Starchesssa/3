1. (0.00 - 9.30) - a geometric vector illustration style of a middle-aged male silhouette in a dark business suit, standing lost and confused at a crossroads. He is shrugging with his hands up, looking at two different paths. In the parallax background, a glowing "Microsoft" logo is on one wall and a "Nokia" logo on the other, surrounded by a swirling pattern representing chaos.

2. (9.78 - 15.78) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male silhouette in a business suit, nonchalantly throwing stacks of burning money into a giant, roaring bonfire. The parallax background is a dark, industrial space with the words "BILLION BONFIRE" glowing ominously on the concrete wall behind the flames.

3. (16.30 - 24.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of two male silhouettes in suits making a desperate, forceful handshake across a long boardroom table. The parallax background features a large screen displaying a glitching and fading "Windows Phone" logo, signifying a failing product.

4. (24.72 - 33.40) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male silhouette in a slightly ill-fitting suit looking into a large mirror. His reflection is a sleeker, more confident silhouette holding a glowing apple. In the parallax background, the words "Like Apple" are scrawled on the wall next to the mirror.

5. (34.02 - 41.68) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male silhouette in a suit recoiling in shock as he signs a contract on a desk, which immediately erupts into flames at the touch of his pen. The parallax background shows the office walls cracking and crumbling, with the word "CATASTROPHE" visible through a large fissure.

6. (42.20 - 53.50) - a geometric vector illustration style of two male silhouettes in tattered business suits, shackled together at the ankle, sinking helplessly into dark, turbulent water. In the deep parallax background, the word "DROWNING" is subtly formed by the underwater currents and rising bubbles.

7. (53.50 - 66.20) - a geometric vector illustration style of several male silhouettes in suits around a boardroom table that is split down the middle by a large crack. One figure pushes forward aggressively while the others lean back with their arms crossed in opposition. The parallax background shows a starkly lit wall with the word "NO" repeated in a fading pattern.

8. (66.78 - 81.56) - a geometric vector illustration style of a lone male silhouette in a suit, standing on a desolate battlefield, futilely firing a gun that shoots dollar bills at two massive, undamaged fortresses in the distance, one with an "Apple" logo and one with a "Google" logo. In the parallax background, the words "WAR LOST" are etched into the stormy sky.

9. (81.56 - 96.14) - a geometric vector illustration style of two male silhouettes crashing into each other, creating a violent explosion of pixels and gears. One silhouette is composed of binary code representing software, the other of mechanical parts representing hardware. The parallax background wall has the word "CLASH" cracked down the middle from the impact.

10. (96.72 - 107.28) - a geometric vector illustration style of a defeated male silhouette in a manager's attire, standing amidst a chaotic office, looking down into a large, completely empty treasure chest. In the parallax background, the word "NOTHING" is written in large, hollow letters on the wall.

11. (107.86 - 117.70) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male silhouette in a lab coat desperately trying to revive a crumbling, zombie-like figure with money from a large syringe. The parallax background shows a large screen with a plummeting stock chart labeled "MARKET SHARE".

12. (118.38 - 129.42) - a geometric vector illustration style of a frantic male silhouette in a soot-stained suit, relentlessly shoveling cash into the fiery maw of a giant industrial furnace. In the parallax background, the words "SUNK COST" are glowing red-hot on the furnace door.

13. (129.42 - 139.16) - a geometric vector illustration style of a defeated silhouette of a man in a tattered CEO's suit, kneeling on a crumbling throne that has a cracked "Microsoft" logo. The parallax background is a ruined hall where money is visually "bleeding" from cracks in the walls, and a tattered banner with the words "EPIC FAILURE" hangs crookedly.
