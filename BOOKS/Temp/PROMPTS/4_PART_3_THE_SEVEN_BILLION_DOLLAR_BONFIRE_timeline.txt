1.(0.00-9.30)- A parallax shot inside a vast, minimalist CEO's office at dusk. In the midground, a 3D male silhouette, representing Steve Balmer, stands with his back to the camera, looking out a floor-to-ceiling window at a sprawling, illuminated city. In the foreground, the polished surface of a large, empty boardroom table reflects the silhouette's contemplative but lost posture. The city lights in the far background are slightly blurred, creating a sense of depth and isolation.

2.(9.78-15.78)- A conceptual, dark image with a parallax effect. The foreground features a slightly out-of-focus stack of business documents. In the midground, a translucent digital furnace glows ominously, with 3D models of dollar bills turning into digital embers inside. The background is a dark, abstract grid, representing a corporate abyss. The focus is on the "bonfire" of money, looking stark and wasteful.

3.(16.30-24.72)- A cinematic parallax shot capturing a pivotal moment. In the midground, two 3D male silhouettes, one subtly glowing with a blue Microsoft motif and the other with a cyan Nokia motif, shake hands over a table. In the foreground, the signed acquisition contract is in sharp focus. The background shows a blurred-out press room with faint flashes of cameras, symbolizing the public finality of the desperate deal.

4.(24.72-33.40)- A stylized parallax image illustrating flawed logic. The scene is a designer's workshop. In the midground, a 3D male silhouette tries to force two mismatched puzzle pieces together – one is a glowing software icon (Windows), and the other is a solid hardware schematic (Nokia). In the background, a perfectly assembled, sleek and glowing smartphone model (representing Apple) sits on a pedestal, highlighting the intended but failed goal. The foreground shows scattered, discarded tools on a workbench.

5.(34.02-41.68)- A dramatic parallax shot symbolizing immediate failure. In the foreground, a close-up of a fountain pen's nib is slightly out of focus. The midground shows a 3D silhouette's hand signing a contract. As the signature completes, the entire document begins to glow with red cracks, like shattering glass, signifying the deal was a catastrophe from the start. The background is a blurred, indifferent corporate hallway.

6.(42.20-53.50)- A symbolic parallax image set in a digital abyss. In the midground, two 3D male silhouettes, shackled together at the wrist by a glowing chain, are sinking slowly. One silhouette is made of circuit board patterns (Microsoft) and the other of brushed metal textures (Nokia). Bubbles of binary code rise around them. The foreground shows the dark, rippling surface of this digital "water," while the background descends into infinite darkness.

7.(53.50-61.84)- A tense parallax shot of a divided boardroom. In the midground, several 3D male silhouettes are seated around a long table. Half the figures are leaning forward in agitated poses, while the other half, including a central figure representing Bill Gates, lean back with arms crossed in disapproval. The background shows a large window with rain streaking down the glass, creating a somber mood. The foreground is the polished, empty surface of the table's edge.

8.(62.28-72.76)- A parallax image of strategic dissent. In the midground, a single 3D male silhouette, representing Satya Nadella, stands apart from a group of executives who are huddled in the background, mesmerized by a large screen showing a chaotic battle plan. The foreground shows piles of digital coins dissolving into pixels on the floor, symbolizing the wasted billions he foresaw.

9.(73.34-81.56)- A stylized parallax image of a hopeless battle. In the foreground, the muddy, glitchy edge of a digital trench. In the midground, a lone 3D silhouette in a Microsoft-branded helmet peers over the edge. In the far background, two colossal, glowing monoliths representing Apple and Google stand tall and unshakable against a dark sky, emphasizing Microsoft's powerless position in the mobile market.

10.(81.56-94.28)- A conceptual parallax image of a culture clash. Two opposing waves of 3D silhouettes are about to collide. On the left, the figures are translucent and made of glowing blue code (Microsoft's software culture). On the right, the figures are solid, metallic, and holding schematics (Nokia's hardware culture). The background is split down the middle, one half a circuit board, the other half brushed aluminum. The foreground shows sparks and digital debris where the two forces are about to meet.

11.(94.90-101.20)- A parallax shot depicting corporate chaos. The midground shows a dysfunctional office where 3D silhouettes are arguing, pointing fingers at each other over cubicle walls. Another silhouette sits with its head in its hands. The background is a large project board filled with crossed-out deadlines and question marks. The foreground is a deliberately tangled mess of computer wires and cables, symbolizing the internal confusion.

12.(101.20-107.28)- A stark parallax shot of failure's result. In the vast, empty, and dark hall of a modern warehouse, a single, obsolete Windows phone rests on a wooden crate in the midground, illuminated by a single spotlight from above. The foreground shows dust particles floating through the beam of light. The background is the cavernous, shadow-filled emptiness of the warehouse, symbolizing the "absolutely nothing" gained from the deal.

13.(107.86-117.70)- A dynamic parallax image of financial drain. In the midground, a massive industrial furnace with a Microsoft logo glows intensely. 3D silhouettes are continuously shoveling bags marked with dollar signs into the fire. In the background, a large digital chart shows a market share line graph for "Windows Phone" flat-lining and then sharply declining into the red. The foreground shows sparks and embers flying towards the camera.

14.(118.38-129.42)- A close-up parallax shot illustrating the sunk cost fallacy. The foreground shows the distorted reflection of a 3D male silhouette on a polished floor. In the midground, the silhouette stands transfixed, holding a shovel and staring into the flames of the money-burning furnace, unable to stop. The background is a swirling vortex of red and black data streams, representing the spiraling financial commitment.

15.(129.42-139.16)- A final, symbolic parallax shot of the ultimate failure. A 3D male silhouette representing Balmer stands alone on a large, crumbling platform shaped like the Windows logo, overlooking a dark abyss. In the far background, the facade of the Microsoft corporate headquarters has large, glowing red cracks running through it, symbolizing bleeding money and morale. The foreground shows small chunks of the logo platform breaking off and falling into the darkness below.
