1.(0.00-9.30)- A parallax shot showing a 3D male silhouette in a suit, representing Steve Ballmer, standing at a dark, confusing crossroads. The Microsoft logo glows faintly behind him. One path ahead is dimly lit, with a sign that says "Nokia's Phone Business."

2.(9.79-15.78)- A dramatic close-up of a massive bonfire made of stacks of hundred-dollar bills. A silhouette stands watching as the flames, rendered with a parallax effect, consume the money. The text "$7.2 BILLION BONFIRE" is superimposed in fiery letters.

3.(16.30-24.72)- A 2D silhouette representing Microsoft, with a flickering Windows Phone logo over its heart, shakes hands with a silhouette representing Nokia, which has a phone factory in its background. A calendar page flips to "2013" in the corner.

4.(24.72-33.40)- A profile view of a male silhouette's head. Inside, a simple animation shows a "Hardware" gear and a "Software" gear locking together perfectly. An arrow points from this mechanism to a glowing, apple-shaped icon.

5.(34.02-41.68)- A close-up of a silhouette's hand signing a contract. As the pen touches the paper, the document begins to crack and glow with a fiery light, with the cracks spreading across the desk. A stock ticker in the background plummets.

6.(42.20-53.50)- A powerful parallax image of two 3D male silhouettes shackled together at the wrist, sinking in dark, choppy water. They struggle but are pulling each other down. Waves in the foreground move faster than the dark clouds in the background.

7.(53.50-61.84)- A long boardroom table filled with arguing silhouettes. The room is visually split down the middle, one side dark, the other slightly lighter. At the head of the table, a prominent silhouette representing Bill Gates has his arms crossed, shaking his head in disapproval.

8.(62.28-66.20)- The camera focuses on one silhouette at the boardroom table, representing Satya Nadella. A glowing cloud icon hovers above his head. He has his hand raised in a clear "NO" gesture, while other figures are blurred in the background.

9.(66.78-72.76)- A silhouette stands on a desolate battlefield littered with broken smartphones. He is throwing large bags of money into a fiery pit labeled "Mobile War". In the distance, two massive, undamaged fortresses labeled "Apple" and "Google" stand tall.

10.(73.34-81.56)- A stylized shot from inside a trench labeled "Microsoft". A lone silhouette peeks over the edge at the towering fortresses of "Apple" and "Google". Outside the trench, a crowd of consumer silhouettes has their backs turned.

11.(81.56-94.28)- A dynamic parallax scene. A giant figure made of glowing blue computer code ("Microsoft") crashes headfirst into a giant figure made of metallic phone parts and gears ("Nokia"). Sparks and binary digits fly at the point of impact.

12.(94.90-101.20)- A chaotic office scene with frantic 2D silhouettes. Two figures are arguing, papers are flying, and project timelines on a whiteboard are covered in "DELAYED" stamps. A giant question mark hovers over an empty manager's chair.

13.(101.20-107.28)- A 3D silhouette opens a giant, elegantly wrapped gift box labeled "$7.2 Billion". A puff of smoke erupts, revealing the box to be completely empty. The silhouette slumps in disappointment.

14.(107.86-111.84)- An animated bar graph shows market share. The "Apple" and "Google" bars are massive. The "Windows Phone" bar is tiny. A red arrow appears and pushes the "Windows Phone" bar down until it's barely visible.

15.(112.46-117.70)- A zombie-like silhouette with a cracked phone screen for a face shuffles forward. It's kept alive by a large machine labeled "Microsoft HQ," which is being fed stacks of cash by another silhouette. The cash turns to energy flowing through tubes to the zombie.

16.(118.38-129.42)- A parallax shot of a male silhouette frantically shoveling bags of money into a massive, roaring furnace with "SUNK COST" written on the side. The pile of money behind him is enormous, but he continues to feed the fire.

17.(129.42-139.16)- A final, dramatic image of a CEO silhouette (Ballmer) standing on a crumbling pedestal. Streams of money pour out from the cracks like blood. In the background, the Microsoft corporate building is shown with a giant crack down its facade and low morale indicated by slumping silhouettes of employees.
