1.(0.00-9.30)- a geometric vector illustration style of a middle-aged executive silhouette in a suit, looking lost and confused at a digital crossroads. His abstract angular head is tilted, and his hands are outstretched in a questioning pose. In the background, the words "LOST" and "NOKIA" are displayed in a bold, glitchy font within a dark, parallax maze.

2.(9.78-15.78)- a geometric vector illustration style of an executive silhouette with an abstract angular head, captured in a dynamic pose as he throws huge stacks of cash into a roaring fire. The bonfire is made of burning smartphones. In the background of the dark industrial scene, the words "$7 BILLION BONFIRE" are emblazoned on a wall in a stark, impactful font.

3.(16.30-24.72)- a geometric vector illustration style of a desperate executive silhouette on one knee, offering a glowing contract to a taller, imposing silhouette representing Nokia. The scene is a minimalist boardroom overlooking a city, with the Microsoft and Nokia logos subtly placed on opposite ends of a long table, creating a parallax effect.

4.(24.72-33.40)- a geometric vector illustration style of a silhouette with an abstract angular head in a suit, awkwardly trying to mimic a confident pose it sees in a mirror. The reflection, however, is of a sleek Apple-like figure. In the background, the word "APPLE" is projected onto the wall, emphasizing the theme of flawed imitation.

5.(34.02-41.68)- a geometric vector illustration style of two executive silhouettes, one with a Microsoft emblem and one with a Nokia emblem, shaking hands. As they connect, the ground beneath them cracks and shatters into a deep chasm, their bodies recoiling in shock. The background is filled with the word "CATASTROPHE" in a fractured, falling font.

6.(42.20-53.50)- a geometric vector illustration style of two angular silhouettes, shackled together at the wrist, flailing and sinking in deep digital water made of binary code. Their poses are desperate as they pull each other down. In the background, the word "DROWNING" is faintly visible in the murky, parallaxing depths.

7.(53.50-61.84)- a geometric vector illustration style of a tense boardroom meeting. A central executive silhouette aggressively pushes a document forward, while other silhouettes on one side of the table cross their arms and lean back in dissent. The sharp angles of the room and the word "SPLIT" projected on the back wall create a feeling of internal conflict.

8.(62.28-72.76)- a geometric vector illustration style of a lone silhouette, representing Satya Nadella, standing calmly on a hill with his hand raised in a "stop" gesture. He has his back turned to a chaotic battlefield below, where other figures are throwing money into a pit. In the smoky sky, the words "WAR LOST" are visible.

9.(73.34-81.56)- a geometric vector illustration style of a small, lone Microsoft silhouette cowering in a trench. Towering over him are two giant, monolithic silhouettes representing Apple and Google, casting long, oppressive shadows. The words "ZERO POWER" are carved into the parallax layers of the trench wall.

10.(81.56-94.28)- a geometric vector illustration style of two abstract figures colliding in a violent, mid-air explosion. One figure is made of glowing software code (Microsoft) and the other is a solid, metallic hardware shape (Nokia). In the background, the words "CULTURE CLASH" are shattering like glass.

11.(94.90-101.20)- a geometric vector illustration style of a chaotic office where multiple executive silhouettes are in aggressive poses, pointing fingers at each other amidst flying papers. One figure stands in the middle with a confused shrug. The word "CHAOS" is written in a messy, graffiti-style font on the back wall.

12.(101.20-107.28)- a geometric vector illustration style of a single executive silhouette with an abstract angular head, standing in a vast, empty white void. He holds his hands out, palms up, showing they are completely empty. Behind him, a massive, empty vault with the Microsoft logo reinforces the scene, with the word "NOTHING" fading in the background.

13.(107.86-117.70)- a geometric vector illustration style of a silhouette in a suit, straining to push a sinking bar graph labeled "Market Share" upwards. The graph is attached to a furnace labeled "ZOMBIE DIVISION," which is burning money. The character's pose is one of futile, exhausting effort against inevitable decline.

14.(118.38-129.42)- a geometric vector illustration style of a line of executive silhouettes in robotic, repetitive poses, shoveling glowing money into a massive furnace shaped like a broken smartphone. The words "SUNK COST" are glowing like embers on the furnace door, highlighting the irrationality of their actions.

15.(129.42-139.16)- a geometric vector illustration style of a lone, defeated silhouette with a slumped posture, standing on a crumbling pedestal that is bleeding money. In the desolate landscape behind him, under a stormy sky, the word "FAILURE" is carved into a mountain in a grand, epic font.
