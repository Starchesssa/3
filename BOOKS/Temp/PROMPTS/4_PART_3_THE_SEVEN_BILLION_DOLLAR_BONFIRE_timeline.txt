1. (0.00-9.30) - A middle-aged 3D male silhouette in a business suit stands lost at a digital crossroads, shrugging with arms outstretched in confusion, unsure which path to take in a dark, abstract environment with parallax code floating by.

2. (9.78-15.78) - A 3D male silhouette in a suit frantically shovels stacks of glowing green cash into a roaring bonfire, with embers shaped like dollar signs floating up in a dark, cavernous space with parallax smoke effects.

3. (16.30-21.14) - A tired, 3D male silhouette in a suit is down on one knee, desperately reaching up for a single, flickering Windows Phone logo that hovers just out of reach in a stark, minimalist room with a single spotlight and parallax grid lines.

4. (21.66-28.38) - A confident 3D male silhouette in a sharp suit forces a glowing phone-shaped puzzle piece into a board where it clearly doesn't fit, in an abstract, blueprint-like world with parallax schematics floating in the background.

5. (28.86-37.46) - A 3D male silhouette in a business suit poses confidently in front of a funhouse mirror, which reflects a distorted, warped version of the Apple logo, set in a dark room with parallax layers of broken code.

6. (38.28-53.50) - Two 3D male silhouettes, shackled at the wrist, struggle and pull each other down as they drown in a murky, deep blue ocean, with parallax debris of broken phones sinking around them.

7. (53.50-66.20) - Inside a boardroom split by shadow and light, a 3D male silhouette pounds a fist on the table, while another silhouette stands up in opposition, pushing his chair back with a hand raised to stop, against a parallax city view at night.
