1.(0.00-9.79)- A sharp, angular figure in a suit stands at a diverging crossroads in a rain-slicked, neon-noir city; the figure's pose is stooped and looking down a dark, ominous path marked with a flickering Nokia logo.

2.(9.79-15.78)- A single, geometric figure stands with arms slightly raised in a pose of awe and horror before a massive, glitching bonfire of burning digital dollar signs and smartphone silhouettes in a dark, cavernous hall.

3.(16.30-28.38)- A geometric character representing a CEO stands in a high-tech office, confidently trying to force two mismatched, glowing puzzle pieces together—one a Microsoft logo, the other a Nokia logo—in a pose of misguided certainty.

4.(28.86-37.46)- A sharp-angled figure reaches out with a longing pose towards its own reflection in a dark mirror, where the reflection is warped into a sleek, successful 'Apple'-like silhouette holding a perfect device.

5.(38.28-53.50)- Two angular figures, one glowing Microsoft blue and the other Nokia cyan, are shackled together; their bodies are contorted in a desperate, drowning pose as they sink into a dark ocean of binary code, pulling each other down.

6.(53.50-66.20)- In a dark cyberpunk boardroom, one central figure slams its fist on a holographic table in a pose of assertion, while two other figures lean back with arms crossed and hands raised in poses of clear dissent and opposition.

7.(66.78-81.56)- A lone, defeated figure kneels in the center of a vast, empty digital arena, its head bowed and holding a shattered geometric sword; in the background, towering logos for Apple and Google loom like giant, victorious scoreboards.

8.(81.56-96.14)- Two abstract figures, one of solid cyan metal (Nokia) and one of glitching blue code (Microsoft), collide violently in mid-air in an aggressive, crashing pose, shattering into digital fragments against a stark, black background.

9.(96.72-110.20)- A central figure is contorted in a pained pose, being pulled in multiple directions by glowing digital ropes while desperately trying to hold up a massive, plummeting red line on a holographic graph behind it.

10.(110.46-122.04)- A hunched, weary figure is caught in the mechanical, repetitive pose of shoveling glowing cubes of cash into the roaring, fiery maw of a massive furnace emblazoned with a broken Windows Phone logo.

11.(122.50-139.16)- A geometric figure stands in a defiant, king-like pose atop a mountain of shattered smartphones, but its body is glitching and dissolving into pixels as glowing blue light leaks from its chest like a bleeding wound.
