With the Nokia disaster unfolding and Steve Ballmer stepping down, the company was adrift.
1. (nokia disaster) - Recreate the famous photo of Richard Nixon's departure from the White House, but the high fashion 3d silhouette of a business figure is stepping out of a broken Nokia phone instead of a helicopter, illuminated by the four glowing colors of the Microsoft logo.
2. (stepping down) - The same silhouette waves goodbye from the cracked screen, a bleak landscape of obsolete technology visible behind him, under a moody, four-colored sky.

The hunt for a new CEO was a panicked circus.
1. (absolute circus) - Recreate the iconic PayPal Mafia photo from Fortune magazine, with the high fashion 3d silhouettes of the Microsoft board posed like a chaotic troupe, their faces shadowed under dramatic lighting in Microsoft's blue, green, orange, and yellow.
2. (in a) - The setting is a surreal boardroom that resembles a circus tent, with stock charts projected onto the canvas walls like distorted reflections in a funhouse mirror.

Alan Mulally, the rockstar CEO of Ford, was the top choice.
1. (alan mulally) - Recreate Steve Jobs' 2007 iPhone introduction, with a high fashion 3d silhouette in the classic black turtleneck pose, but on stage under a single, intense Ford-blue spotlight.
2. (ceo of) - Instead of an iPhone, the silhouette dramatically reveals a gleaming, futuristic car engine block that glows with an inner blue light, the Ford logo subtly etched on its side.

But Mulally wisely rejected the offer, seeing the toxic internal politics as a snake pit.
1. (board structure) - Recreate the tense Yalta Conference photograph, with high fashion 3d silhouettes of Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer on one side of a long table, and a single silhouette representing Alan Mulally on the other, turning his chair away from them.
2. (snake pit) - The table is lit from below by the garish Microsoft brand colors, casting long, menacing shadows that writhe on the wall behind the figures like serpents.

Back to square one, the job was now seen as a poisoned chalice that nobody wanted.
1. (square one) - Recreate the famous 1999 photo of Jeff Bezos in his office, with a lone high fashion 3d silhouette sitting at a makeshift desk in a sparse room, the Microsoft logo crudely spray-painted on the wall behind him.
2. (poisoned chalice) - On the desk sits a single, ornate goblet glowing with a sickly green and yellow light, casting a toxic aura over the entire scene.

A quiet insider, the thoughtful engineer Satya Nadella, emerged as a candidate.
1. (satya nadella) - Recreate the iconic photo of a young Bill Gates sitting on a massive pile of paper, but instead have the high fashion 3d silhouette of Satya Nadella sitting calmly atop a mountain of glowing blue server racks.
2. (thoughtful engineer) - Streams of data, rendered as light trails in Microsoft Azure blue, flow around him, illuminating his shadowed face as he thoughtfully inspects a line of code projected in the air.

The board feared this safe choice couldn't perform the radical surgery the broken culture needed.
1. (radical surgery) - Recreate Rembrandt's painting "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp," with high fashion 3d silhouettes as the surgeons, all wearing gloves and gathered around an operating table.
2. (broken culture) - The patient on the table is a shattered, classic four-color Microsoft Windows logo, with Satya Nadella's silhouette holding a scalpel that glows with a brilliant new Azure blue light.

The company was a leaderless giant, in limbo for five agonizing months.
1. (leaderless giant) - Recreate the famous photograph "Lunch atop a Skyscraper," with the high fashion 3d silhouettes of the Microsoft board sitting precariously on a steel girder high above a sprawling city.
2. (savior who) - At the far end of the girder sits an empty, ornate chair that glows softly, while the silhouettes look out anxiously, their faces hidden in the shadows of the leaderless void.
