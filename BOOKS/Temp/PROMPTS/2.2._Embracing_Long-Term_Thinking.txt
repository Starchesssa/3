Here are 15 image prompts in the style of Kurzgesagt, one for each sentence:

1.  A split-screen view. On the left, a single, small, glowing yellow orb labeled "NOW". On the right, a large, transparent, glowing blue cube filled with dozens of small yellow orbs, labeled "5 YEARS". A simple path splits to lead to both options.

2.  A glowing, abstract triangular shape, representing a choice, moves decisively along a brightly illuminated path towards the large blue cube of orbs. The path to the single orb is greyed out and dim.

3.  A simple timeline graphic. On the left, a jagged, dark red, spiky shape labeled "PAIN". A long, bright arrow connects it to the right side, which features a massive, radiant, golden cube labeled "REWARD".

4.  A stylized, vibrant line graph on a dark background. The line, which was climbing, is suddenly struck by a jagged, electric-blue lightning bolt at its peak, causing it to shatter and plunge downwards.

5.  A close-up on a minimalist infographic graph. A glowing green line plummets downwards, leaving a trail of fading particles. The x-axis is marked with simple icons for "1999" and "2001".

6.  The falling line graph is frozen. A bright circular marker at the peak is labeled "$107". A second marker at the very bottom is labeled "$6". A dramatic, dashed red arrow connects the two points vertically.

7.  A large, circular gauge, almost entirely filled with a dark, ominous red color. A tiny, bright green sliver remains. In the center, the text "-94%" is displayed in bold, stark white.

8.  A schematic of an abstract machine made of interconnected gears and glowing circuits. Large red "X" symbols appear over several gears, and glowing energy lines are being severed, causing parts of the machine to go dark.

9.  A single, bold, glowing teal arrow moves in one direction, then makes a sharp 180-degree U-turn, going against the flow of numerous faint, grey arrows that continue straight ahead.

10. A dual-panel infographic. In the top panel, a container labeled "VALUE" is rapidly draining, with glowing particles flowing out. In the bottom panel, these same particles are being used to construct an expanding network of interconnected, geometric, hexagonal hubs.

11. A central, glowing, geometric structure is surrounded by dozens of floating, transparent circles. Inside each circle is a red, flashing warning sign or a simplified, frowning face icon.

12. A futuristic blueprint schematic. A small, visible section in the foreground shows chaotic red lines. The blueprint stretches far into the background, revealing a massive, perfectly ordered, and intricate final structure, with a "7 YEAR" timeline marker.

13. The completed hexagonal network from prompt 10 now covers the screen, pulsating with vibrant energy. Bright, streamlined packets of light shoot rapidly and efficiently between the hubs along glowing pathways.

14. A massive, glowing, intricate structure representing an "empire" stands tall. Its deep foundation, visible below a ground line, is made of the same jagged, dark red, spiky shape from prompt 3, now solidified and stable.

15. The large, glowing cube is now open. A holographic, miniature version of the vast, pulsating global network from prompt 13 emanates from it, shining brilliantly against a deep, cosmic background.
