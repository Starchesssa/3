(hunger games) - recreate the iconic PayPal Mafia photo with high-fashion 3d male silhouettes who are secretly trying to kill each other, their gloved hands subtly holding daggers behind their backs, all under dramatic lighting based on Microsoft brand colors. (zero-sum game) - the group of shadowed business figures should look like paranoid, backstabbing politicians instead of collaborators, with one figure isolated from the group in a harsh spotlight.

(crippled innovation) - recreate Jeff Bezos's famous 1999 office photo, but instead of books and a spray-painted "Amazon.com" sign, the room is sterile and filled with ominous performance review charts and graphs illustrating the stack ranking system. (stupidly slow) - the lone high-fashion 3d male silhouette at the desk isn't building anything, but is instead anxiously studying a bell curve chart that glows with a toxic Microsoft green and red light. (stack ranking) - on the wall behind him, a menacing, oversized, and glowing Microsoft logo casts long, distorted shadows across the room.

(poor performers) - recreate Steve Jobs' 2007 iPhone introduction stage, but the high-fashion 3d male silhouette on stage is not revealing a product, but pointing towards a giant screen displaying a corporate performance chart. (stab them) - the chart on the screen has a bell curve with one section labeled "poor performers" highlighted in a menacing, pulsating Microsoft red. (label one) - the gloved hand of the silhouette on stage is pointing directly at one name on the "poor performers" list, singling them out for termination in a moment of corporate betrayal.
