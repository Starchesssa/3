1.(0.00-6.34)- A slow parallax shot moving past rain-streaked glass. In the midground, the imposing, dark silhouette of a Microsoft campus building stands against a gloomy dusk sky. Only a few windows are lit, suggesting a hollowed-out giant.

2.(6.34-14.52)- A wide, dramatic shot of a stylized, glowing globe in a dark room. Lines of light representing global data connections all converge on a massive, floating Windows logo. In the foreground, the dark 3D silhouettes of executives stand on a balcony, observing their worldwide dominance.

3.(15.12-27.02)- An animated stock chart with a timeline from 2001 to 2011 is the central focus. A glowing, completely flat line represents Microsoft's stock price. The chart is superimposed over a shot of a sterile, empty corporate office, creating a sense of deep stagnation. The parallax effect makes the chart appear to float in front of the empty desks.

4.(27.02-38.58)- A view from inside a dark, still Microsoft boardroom. 3D silhouettes of executives sit motionless, almost ghost-like, around a large table. Through the massive window behind them, the outside world is vibrant and fast-moving, with blurred silhouettes of people excitedly using early iPhones and laptops.

5.(39.68-57.62)- A low-angle shot of a 3D male silhouette on a stage, representing Steve Ballmer. He is captured mid-motion, arm raised in a passionate gesture under harsh stage lights. The massive screen behind him repeats the word "WINDOWS" in a bold font. The camera's parallax movement creates a dramatic lens flare in the foreground.

6.(58.04-69.26)- A 3D male silhouette stands guard protectively in front of a giant, glowing golden goose labeled "WINDOWS." In the background, blurred icons representing mobile phones, search engines, and social media speed past and fade, symbolizing missed opportunities.

7.(69.94-82.08)- A stylized digital map is shown. On one side is a large, grey, fortified castle labeled "Microsoft." Across a vast digital ocean, a new, vibrant continent is brightly lit, with areas marked "Mobile," "Search," and "Cloud." The castle is isolated and dark while the new continent thrives with activity.

8.(82.90-99.06)- A close-up on a 3D silhouette's hand holding an early Windows Phone. The phone's blocky, tiled interface looks dated. In the slightly out-of-focus background, other silhouettes are happily swiping and tapping on sleek devices that resemble early iPhones and Androids, highlighting how Microsoft missed the design trend.

9.(99.70-108.82)- A massive 3D pie chart materializes in a dark, abstract space. Two enormous slices, labeled "iOS" and "Android," take up almost the entire circle. A tiny, pathetic sliver, barely visible, is marked "Windows Phone - 3%." A single, defeated 2D silhouette stands below, looking up at the chart.

10.(110.70-120.08)- A scene inside a messy and demoralized Microsoft R&D lab. In the foreground, a failed Zune music player sits under a single spotlight on a desk. In the midground, 2D silhouettes of engineers slump in their chairs, their postures conveying exhaustion. A whiteboard in the background is filled with crossed-out plans.

11.(120.82-130.14)- A conceptual animation showing a cross-section of a huge building labeled "Microsoft." In the upper floors, 2D silhouettes are frantically throwing product ideas at a wall, where they shatter. Down in the building's foundation, the core structure, labeled "Windows," is shown with growing cracks, slowly rotting from within.

12.(131.06-136.30)- A slow, cinematic zoom through rows of blinking server racks. The camera settles on the center of the vast data center, where there is an empty, glowing pedestal. A single 3D silhouette stands before the empty space, head bowed, representing a company that has lost its core purpose, its soul.
