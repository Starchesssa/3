1.  **(0.00-9.32)** - A dark, cavernous, modern office. Rain streaks down a massive window. A lone **3D male silhouette** stares out at the city lights. QUICK CUT to archival-style footage (grainy, 4:3 aspect ratio): The world rapidly adopting Windows. A fast-paced montage shows the Windows 95 startup sound taking over the globe, computer screens in every home and office booting up with the iconic logo. The parallax effect shows text like "DOMINANCE" and "MONOPOLY" floating in the foreground as the montage plays behind it.

2.  **(9.32-14.52)** - A stylized world map made of glowing pixels. 90% of the landmass pulses with the blue of the Windows logo. The camera dramatically zooms out to reveal a colossal **3D male silhouette** standing atop this digital globe, arms crossed, looking down like a titan. The parallax effect creates depth, with clouds of data and code swirling between the camera and the globe, making the silhouette seem untouchable and monumental.

3.  **(14.52-27.02)** - The screen shows a vibrant, jagged MSFT stock chart from the 90s, climbing aggressively upwards. As the narrator says "stopped," the line hits a peak in 2001 and then goes perfectly, unnaturally flat. A time-lapse begins over the flat line. Years (2002, 2003, 2004...) flash on screen. The parallax effect shows calendar pages flying off in the foreground, while in the background, the sun and moon cycle rapidly, but the stock line remains frozen, dead straight.

4.  **(27.02-38.58)** - A sharp split-screen. On the left, a dynamic, exciting scene: silhouettes dancing with white iPods, a finger swiping to unlock a sleek new iPhone, colorful Google doodles morphing and changing. The background is bright and energetic. On the right, a muted, grey-toned Microsoft campus building. A translucent, ghost-like **2D silhouette** floats through an empty hallway. The parallax effect has dust motes drifting slowly in the foreground of the Microsoft side, emphasizing the stagnation.

5.  **(38.58-54.28)** - On a massive stage, under harsh spotlights, a **3D male silhouette** (representing Ballmer) is captured mid-shout. He is drenched in stylized, glowing sweat that flies off him in slow motion. The background is a chaotic, energetic graphic of a nuclear reactor core glowing an intense, unstable red. The parallax effect makes the words "DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPERS" fly out from his mouth towards the camera, seeming to pop off the screen.

6.  **(54.28-69.26)** - A **3D silhouette** (Ballmer) is shown with stylized horse blinders on. He is obsessively polishing a giant, glowing golden egg with the Windows logo etched onto it. The parallax effect is crucial here: in the out-of-focus background, sleek, futuristic silhouettes representing competitors zip by on light cycles, building towers of light, completely unnoticed by the figure focused on the egg.

7.  **(69.26-82.08)** - A wide shot of a formidable, grey castle flying a Windows flag. Inside, **2D silhouettes** of guards are marching, looking inward, protecting the castle walls. The camera pulls back, and back, and back, revealing the castle is on a small, eroding island. Across a vast sea, a new, vibrant continent is lit up, with cities named "MOBILE," "SEARCH," and "SOCIAL." The parallax effect makes the new continent feel immense and distant, emphasizing how far Microsoft had been left behind.

8.  **(82.08-92.62)** - The scene is inside the castle's throne room. The **silhouette of Ballmer** is on the throne as water begins to seep in from the cracks in the floor. He looks down, suddenly panicked. QUICK CUT to a black, sleek monolith (the iPhone) falling from the sky like a meteor. It crashes into a field of old, beige CRT monitors, causing a shockwave that shatters them all into pixels. The parallax gives the explosion of pixels a 3D feel.

9.  **(92.62-104.38)** - A giant, animated pie chart slams onto the screen. Two massive, bright sections are labeled "iOS" and "ANDROID." A tiny, flickering, pathetic 3% sliver is labeled "WINDOWS PHONE." A **2D silhouette** frantically tries to push the sliver to make it bigger, but it just crumbles into dust. The parallax effect shows the numbers "97%" floating dominantly in the foreground.

10. **(104.38-120.08)** - A split-screen. On the left, a silhouette holds up a simple, iconic white iPod. On the right, a silhouette awkwardly holds a clunky, brown Zune player. The word "JOKE" is stamped over the Zune in big, red letters, like a reject stamp. The parallax shows a laugh track ("HA HA HA") floating in front of the Zune image. CUT TO an interior shot of an office where demoralized **2D silhouettes** are slumped over their desks, some making paper airplanes out of corporate memos.

11. **(120.08-130.14)** - A single, large **3D silhouette** in a suit stands before a huge concrete wall. He is frantically throwing different objects at it—a brown Zune, a square Kin phone, a disc labeled "VISTA." They all hit the wall and shatter, failing to stick. As he throws them, the camera pans along the wall, which is the facade of the Microsoft campus. The parallax effect highlights deep cracks spreading from the points of impact, with bits of the building crumbling away, revealing a dark, rotting core underneath.

12. **(130.14-136.30)** - A slow, cinematic zoom into a vast, architecturally beautiful but completely empty glass atrium at the heart of the Microsoft campus. It's a hollow shell. In the exact center of the immense space, there is a single, tiny, flickering light bulb, barely illuminating anything. A lone **3D male silhouette** stands watching it, lost in the cavernous void. The parallax layers the glass walkways and empty floors, creating a profound sense of scale and emptiness. The final image is of the flickering light, threatening to go out.
