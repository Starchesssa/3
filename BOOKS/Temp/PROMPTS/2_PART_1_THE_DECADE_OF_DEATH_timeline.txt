1.  (0.00 - 9.32) - A 3D middle-aged male silhouette in a sharp business suit stands in a powerful pose, arms outstretched, overlooking a vast digital world from a throne made of glowing code. The sky is dominated by a giant, radiant Windows logo acting as the sun, all in parallax.
2.  (9.32 - 17.14) - A powerful 3D male silhouette in a suit stands firm with arms crossed atop a massive, unbreachable fortress made of glowing Windows logos. His pose is one of complete invincibility as competitors' logos are shown as distant, tiny specks in a dark sky, all in parallax.
3.  (17.14 - 27.02) - A 3D male silhouette in a business suit is frozen mid-stride, trapped inside a dusty, cracked glass cube. He is on a completely flat, gray, endless plane representing a dead stock chart, with a faint, decaying Windows logo in the background, all in parallax.
4.  (27.02 - 38.58) - A translucent, ghostly 3D male silhouette stands on a dark, forgotten road, looking back with a pose of regret. In the distance, bright streaks of light representing Apple and Google race towards a futuristic city, leaving him behind, all in parallax.
5.  (38.58 - 57.62) - A stocky, middle-aged 3D silhouette in a disheveled business shirt is on a stage in a manic pose, leaning forward and screaming with chaotic energy. He is surrounded by a swirling vortex of blinding spotlights and frantic Windows logos, all in parallax.
6.  (57.62 - 69.26) - A tense 3D male silhouette is hunched over, protectively cradling a glowing Windows logo like a "Golden Goose." His pose is turned away from a large window showing a bright, new world of mobile and social media, which he refuses to see, all in parallax.
7.  (69.26 - 82.08) - A lone 3D male silhouette stands on the edge of a tiny, crumbling island of old computer parts. He has a pose of horrified realization, looking across a vast ocean at a distant, thriving new continent made of glowing smartphone skyscrapers, all in parallax.
8.  (82.08 - 92.62) - A 3D male silhouette in a suit recoils in shock, shielding his face as a giant, sleek black monolith (the iPhone) crashes into his world, shattering the ground made of old Windows logos into a million glowing pieces, all in parallax.
9.  (92.62 - 108.82) - A defeated 3D male silhouette is on his knees with his head bowed on a battlefield littered with shattered Windows Phones. In the background, two colossal glowing titans (Android and iOS) stand victorious over the smoking ruins, all in parallax.
10. (108.82 - 130.14) - A stressed 3D male silhouette in a casual business shirt frantically tries to patch huge cracks spreading across the rotting central pillar of a massive, crumbling building. The pillar is a giant, decaying Windows logo, with dark vines creeping over it, all in parallax.
11. (130.14 - 136.30) - A hollow, glass-like 3D silhouette stands in a stark, gray, empty room. His pose is one of quiet despair, looking down at a gaping hole in his chest where a soul should be. A single, flickering light bulb with the Windows logo casts a dying light, all in parallax.
