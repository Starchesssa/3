1.(0.00-9.32)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless angular character standing triumphantly atop a stylized, digital globe. The pose is powerful and commanding, overlooking a world made of glowing geometric circuits, all in parallax.

2.(9.84-14.52)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless angular character sitting confidently on a throne made of stacked, glowing computer windows. The pose is regal and unassailable in a vast hall of digital code, all in parallax.

3.(15.12-21.54)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless angular character frozen mid-stride, encased in a translucent geometric block. The pose is static and rigid while the background of blurred, fast-moving shapes suggests time passing by, all in parallax.

4.(22.00-28.56)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless angular character lying defeated on a single, glowing horizontal line that represents a flat stock chart, stretching across a vast, empty void, all in parallax.

5.(29.00-38.58)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faded, semi-transparent faceless character standing still with a slumped posture, as vibrant, sharp silhouettes race past in a blur of light and motion, all in parallax.

6.(39.68-57.62)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless angular character leaning forward on a stage with arms thrown wide in a manic, energetic pose. Geometric lines of light explode from the character, who is wearing abstract blinders, all in parallax.

7.(58.04-69.26)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless angular character hunched over, protectively shielding a single glowing geometric cube, while other bright opportunities fly past unnoticed in the dark background, all in parallax.

8.(69.94-82.08)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless angular character standing on a tiny, crumbling island castle, turning in a pose of sudden shock to see a massive, vibrant new continent glowing on the distant horizon, all in parallax.

9.(82.90-92.62)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless angular character looking up in awe and fear as a giant, sleek monolith descends from the sky, casting a long, dark shadow over them, all in parallax.

10.(93.30-104.38)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless angular character on their knees, holding up a small, flickering geometric device, dwarfed by two colossal towers that dominate the skyline, all in parallax.

11.(105.12-110.08)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless angular character turning and walking away from a giant scoreboard where two other figures stand victorious on a podium. The character's pose is one of final resignation, all in parallax.

12.(110.70-120.08)- a geometric vector illustration style of several faceless angular characters with slumped shoulders and heads bowed low, standing in a dimly lit, cavernous room filled with broken and discarded geometric products, all in parallax.

13.(120.82-130.14)- a geometric vector illustration style of a faceless angular character in a frantic pose, throwing random geometric shapes at a wall. Behind them, a massive, central pillar representing their core business is cracking and crumbling apart, all in parallax.

14.(131.06-136.30)- a geometric vector illustration style of a translucent, faceless angular character kneeling with a hollow, empty void in its chest. The pose is somber and pleading in a vast, grey, empty landscape, all in parallax.
