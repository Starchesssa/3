1.(0.00-9.32)- A dark and imposing glass office building with a faded Microsoft logo. Rain streaks down the windows. Parallax effect: In the background, a vast, dark, stormy sky. Inside, a lone 2D male silhouette looks out the window at the bleak scene, representing the company's troubled state before its peak is described.

2.(9.32-14.52)- A triumphant 3D male silhouette stands atop a glowing globe. The Windows logo is projected onto the globe's surface, with lines of light connecting it to all continents, symbolizing its 90% market share and "untouchable" status.

3.(15.12-27.02)- A large, digital stock ticker chart dominates the screen. A bright line representing Microsoft's stock price is completely flat, with the years "2001" and "2011" marking the beginning and end. In the background, a dejected 2D male silhouette sits with his head in his hands, watching the stagnant chart.

4.(27.02-38.58)- A split-screen montage. On the left, a silhouette reveals a glowing iPod and then an iPhone. On the right, a Google search bar expands across the screen. In the center, a larger, semi-transparent, ghost-like silhouette stands motionless in front of a faded Microsoft logo. Parallax effect: the Apple and Google panels slowly move forward, while the Microsoft panel recedes into the background.

5.(38.58-57.62)- A low-angle shot of a 3D male silhouette on a stage, arms outstretched, mouth open as if shouting. Abstract lines of energy and sweat particles fly off him. The word "DEVELOPERS" is projected in a huge, bold font on the screen behind him.

6.(57.62-82.08)- A 3D male silhouette (representing Ballmer) is obsessively hugging a large, glowing "Golden Goose" with the Windows logo on its side. His back is turned to a series of closing doors in the background labeled "Mobile," "Search," and "Social Media." He is so focused on the goose that he doesn't notice the world moving on behind him.

7.(82.08-99.06)- A 2D male silhouette is standing in water up to his chest, a look of sudden realization on his face. A sleek, glowing object representing the first iPhone descends from the sky like a monolith, its bright light casting long, dark shadows. The scene then transitions to a pie chart where two massive slices, "iOS" and "Android," are squeezing out a tiny, pathetic sliver labeled "Windows Phone."

8.(99.06-120.08)- Inside a dark, desolate office, several male silhouettes are slumped over their desks, representing low morale. In the foreground, a clunky, unwanted "Zune" music player sits in shadow. In the distant background, a sleek "iPod" stands on a pedestal, glowing brightly and attracting all the light.

9.(120.08-130.14)- An imposing building facade with a cracked and decaying Microsoft logo. In front of it, a confused 2D male silhouette is throwing random shapes against a brick wall, none of which stick. Parallax effect: The silhouette in the foreground is in sharp focus, while the rotting building looms behind him, slightly out of focus.

10.(131.06-136.30)- A close-up on the chest of a transparent, glass-like 3D male silhouette. The figure is hollow and empty inside. With one hand, the silhouette is reaching out towards a single, small, warm glowing orb (a "soul") in the far distance.
