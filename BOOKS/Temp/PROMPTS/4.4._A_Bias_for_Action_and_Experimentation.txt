1. A sleek, stylized rocket ship labeled 'Action' on a vibrant, straight path, far ahead of a complex, glowing, multi-faceted crystal labeled 'Perfection' on a slow, winding path. Kurzgesagt style, vibrant colors, clean lines.

2. A minimalist infographic showing a timeline. On the left, a stylized data gauge is filling up towards a '90%' marker. At that exact point on the timeline, a vibrant, glowing gate labeled 'Opportunity' slams shut.

3. An abstract diagram where a circular data gauge fills to a '70%' mark, launching a glowing arrow forward. The arrow's initial path is slightly off-target, but a small, corrective energy burst nudges it onto the correct trajectory.

4. A large, glowing, stylized 'Undo' button in the center of the frame. A vibrant energy path extends out from a starting node, but a dotted line shows the path arcing back to the beginning, symbolizing a reversible action.

5. A highly simplified, abstract geometric block representing a smartphone, glowing with an ominous red light. Next to it, a large, vibrant yellow exclamation mark pulses with energy against a dark, minimalist background.

6. Two giant, abstract monoliths face each other on a futuristic plane. One monolith has a simple, glowing arrow-smile emblem; the other has a minimalist, glowing apple-shaped cutout. A small, glowing rectangle is launched from the first monolith.

7. The abstract, glowing rectangle from the previous prompt is shown plummeting downwards and shattering into hundreds of tiny, glowing geometric shards upon impact with a flat plane. A large, transparent red 'X' overlays the scene.

8. A simple, clean infographic chart. On the left, a tall, glowing blue bar is labeled '$199'. A dramatic, steep, red arrow points down to a tiny, almost flat bar on the right labeled '99Â¢'.

9. A large, abstract, geometric vault with a stylized arrow-smile logo. A huge, jagged crack runs down its side, with glowing, golden energy particles and geometric shapes spilling out onto the floor.

10. An abstract infographic of a warehouse filled with endless rows of simple, dark rectangular boxes. A large, transparent red overlay covers the scene, with the text '$170,000,000' glowing brightly in the center.

11. A minimalist infographic diagram. A large, glowing red block labeled 'Phone Loss' is shown fitting into a larger, darker container labeled 'Total Quarterly Loss', visually representing it as a significant portion of the whole.

12. In the center of a dark, abstract field of shattered geometric pieces, a single, brilliant point of light begins to glow and emit vibrant, hopeful rays, illuminating the debris around it.

13. The shattered geometric shards from the 'failure' prompt are now being drawn together by glowing lines of energy, starting to reassemble not into their original shape, but into a new, circular form.

14. An abstract flow chart. A box containing glowing, complex circuits labeled 'Phone Technology' has a bright, flowing arrow pointing towards two new shapes: a simple, glowing cylinder and a pulsating, circular soundwave icon.

15. The glowing cylinder from the previous prompt is at the bottom of the screen, emitting waves of energy upwards. These waves form a massive, shimmering, ever-growing bar graph of light that reaches the top of the frame, labeled '$10 Billion'.

16. A clear infographic timeline. On the far left, a shattered rectangle. A single, bright, glowing line connects it directly to a glowing cylinder on the right. From the cylinder, millions of tiny lines branch out, each ending in a small, illuminated dot, creating a vast network.

17. A stylized, upward-spiraling infographic. The spiral consists of three repeating icons: a vibrant green 'Play' arrow for 'Act', a large red 'X' for 'Fail', and a massive, glowing blue lightbulb icon for 'Learn'. Each loop of the spiral is larger than the last.
