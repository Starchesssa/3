1.(0.00-9.40)- a geometric vector illustration style of a confident 3D silhouette in a sharp suit, representing Nadella, standing with a poised posture while in the parallax background, other business silhouettes scratch their abstract angular heads in confusion, set against a sleek, corporate environment.

2.(9.40-16.72)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D silhouette in a suit making a grand presenting gesture towards a glowing Mojang logo, with digital dollar signs and the text "$2.5 BILLION" floating around him in a dynamic parallax effect.

3.(17.56-28.96)- a geometric vector illustration style of a child-like 3D silhouette with an angular head, enthusiastically placing a glowing cube onto a massive, complex structure in a vibrant, blocky world where even the clouds are cubes, creating a deep parallax landscape.

4.(29.65-33.96)- a geometric vector illustration style of several 3D silhouettes in sharp business suits, posed aggressively, shaking their fists and pointing accusingly, with the words "WALL STREET" in a bold, angry font in the parallax background of crashing stock tickers.

5.(34.56-46.96)- a geometric vector illustration style of a 3D business silhouette leaning forward and screaming, with an accusatory finger pointed, caught between the background words "KID'S GAME?" and a glowing "CLOUD" icon, representing conflicting demands in a parallax setting.

6.(47.68-56.98)- a geometric vector illustration style of a calm, large 3D silhouette of Nadella with outstretched arms, as if presenting a vision, with streams of light flowing from his hands towards a crowd of smaller, younger silhouettes in the parallax background, with the glowing words "FUTURE CREATORS" above them.

7.(57.50-76.48)- a geometric vector illustration style of 3D child silhouettes with angular heads collaborating in a blocky world; one places a block, another looks at a holographic blueprint, while glowing code brackets `< >` float around them, showing a parallax world of learning.

8.(77.00-91.94)- a geometric vector illustration style of a massive, glowing globe made of digital blocks, being built by countless tiny 3D silhouettes connected by lines of light, with the words "GLOBAL COMMUNITY" shining in the vast, cosmic parallax background.

9.(92.50-115.72)- a geometric vector illustration style of a young 3D silhouette playing with digital blocks on the left, with a bright path made of the Microsoft logo leading to the right where they become a tall, professional silhouette, with faded Google and Apple logos in the distant parallax background.

10.(116.28-130.26)- a geometric vector illustration style of a teacher-like 3D silhouette pointing towards a large, holographic blocky model of a pyramid in a modern classroom, as smaller student silhouettes look on in awe, with "MINECRAFT EDUCATION" written on a banner in the parallax background.

11.(130.84-154.20)- a geometric vector illustration style of a dynamic 3D silhouette in a suit taking a bold leap across a wide chasm from a crumbling, grey platform labeled "THE PAST" to a bright, glowing platform labeled "THE FUTURE", against a dramatic, angular parallax sky.
