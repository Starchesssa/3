1. (0.00-9.40) - a geometric vector illustration style of a central character with a faceless angular head making a bold forward gesture. He is surrounded by other characters posed scratching their abstract black heads in confusion inside a sharp, layered parallax office environment.

2. (9.40-16.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head posed at a podium, presenting with open arms. A giant parallax screen behind him displays a blocky logo and the text "$2.5 BILLION" above a flow of abstract data streams.

3. (16.72-28.96) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character with a featureless angular head posed dynamically, placing a final glowing cube onto a massive, towering structure made of blocks. The background is a vast parallax landscape of geometric hills and clouds.

4. (28.96-40.62) - a geometric vector illustration style of a group of characters with angular black heads in sharp suits, posed aggressively with arms outstretched, shouting towards a single, calm figure. The environment is a chaotic parallax of jagged, falling stock market lines.

5. (40.62-50.18) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character with a faceless angular head posed at a fork in the road. He confidently turns his back on a path leading to a vector cloud icon and takes a decisive step towards a glowing, blocky structure in a layered parallax environment.

6. (50.18-59.74) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character with a blank angular head posed looking through a futuristic lens. Through the lens, a vibrant parallax world of small characters building with glowing blocks is visible, while behind him, other characters are posed hunched over simple charts.

7. (59.74-67.58) - a geometric vector illustration style of a massive floating cube acting as a platform. On top, several small characters with faceless angular heads are posed actively building, designing, and collaborating in a deep, layered parallax digital void.

8. (67.58-84.22) - a geometric vector illustration style of a stylized globe covered with small characters with blank angular heads. They are all posed reaching out, connected by glowing lines, collaborating on a massive, intricate block structure in a deep space parallax environment.

9. (84.22-102.90) - a geometric vector illustration style showing a parallax time progression. On the left, a small character with a faceless angular head is posed sitting and playing with blocks; on the right, the character is posed as a tall adult, confidently designing a complex holographic blueprint.

10. (102.90-115.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of a character with an abstract angular head posed stepping out of a block-shaped portal, reaching out curiously towards floating, glowing software icons in a dynamic, layered parallax environment.

11. (115.72-130.26) - a geometric vector illustration style of a teacher character with a featureless angular head posed guiding smaller student characters through a block-based re-creation of a historical monument. The student characters are posed looking around with curiosity in the vibrant, layered parallax environment.

12. (130.26-154.20) - a geometric vector illustration style of two characters with abstract angular heads. One is posed looking forward through a telescope at a bright, expansive parallax horizon. The other character is posed defensively, frantically building a wall around themselves and facing away from the future.
