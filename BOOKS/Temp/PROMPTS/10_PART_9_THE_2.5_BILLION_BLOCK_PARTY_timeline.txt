1. (0.00 - 9.40) - a geometric vector illustration style of a middle-aged male silhouette in a sharp business suit, representing a CEO, standing confidently while a group of other businessmen behind him are in confused poses, scratching their heads in parallax. The environment is a sleek, minimalist boardroom with a giant, glowing question mark projected on the wall behind them.

2. (9.40 - 16.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of a middle-aged CEO silhouette on a stage, making a grand announcement with one arm raised. In the background, the words "MOJANG" and "$2.5 BILLION" are displayed on a massive screen, with stylized dollar signs and pixelated blocks raining down in a parallax effect.

3. (16.72 - 28.96) - a geometric vector illustration style of a young male silhouette dynamically placing a glowing cube onto a vast, intricate block structure. The environment is a surreal, digital landscape made of blocks, with the word "MINECRAFT" built into the distant, parallax mountains.

4. (29.65 - 33.96) - a geometric vector illustration style of three older male silhouettes in rumpled suits, representing Wall Street, posed in extreme anger. One slams a fist on a table, while another points an accusatory finger. The background is a chaotic stock exchange floor with the word "BRUTAL" scrawled on a wall in a parallax view.

5. (34.56 - 46.96) - a geometric vector illustration style of an angry businessman silhouette leaning forward and screaming towards the viewer. In the distant parallax background, the word "CLOUD" is glowing aggressively on a data screen, emphasizing the source of his fury.

6. (47.68 - 56.98) - a geometric vector illustration style of a calm, middle-aged CEO silhouette standing on a vast chessboard. He is strategically moving a glowing, cube-shaped pawn forward, his pose one of deep concentration and foresight. The words "FUTURE CREATORS" are subtly etched into the parallax chessboard pattern.

7. (57.50 - 67.58) - a geometric vector illustration style of a CEO silhouette in a suit looking through a large magnifying glass. The main scene is gray and filled with charts, but the view through the lens reveals a vibrant, colorful world being built from blocks, with the word "PLATFORM" visible inside the parallax lens.

8. (68.34 - 84.22) - a geometric vector illustration style of several young male silhouettes actively working together to build a massive city out of glowing blocks. Their poses are collaborative and energetic, surrounded by floating lines of code and blueprints in a parallax effect, with the word "CREATING" integrated into a large structure in the background.

9. (84.22 - 102.90) - a geometric vector illustration style of a young boy silhouette on the floor playing with blocks. On the wall behind him, his shadow is cast as a tall, adult engineer looking at a complex blueprint, creating a parallax effect between present and future. The words "LONG TERM" are written like a timeline on the floor beneath him.

10. (102.90 - 115.72) - a geometric vector illustration style of a teenager silhouette in a hoodie holding a glowing Minecraft block. Holographic icons of other software tools project from the block towards him as he looks on with interest. In the parallax background, a neon sign with the word "COOL" glows brightly on a brick wall.

11. (115.72 - 130.26) - a geometric vector illustration style of a male teacher silhouette gesturing towards a large, holographic globe made entirely of blocks. The environment is a futuristic classroom, with the words "MINECRAFT EDUCATION" written neatly on a digital blackboard in the parallax background.

12. (130.26 - 154.20) - a geometric vector illustration style of a CEO silhouette in a suit standing on a high cliff, turning his back on a crumbling old fortress and looking confidently towards a bright, abstract horizon. The words "STRATEGIC BET" are carved into the parallax cliff face he stands on, signifying a bold move towards the future.
