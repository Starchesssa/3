**124.78 --> 125.04: "I am"**
A medium close-up shot of Satya Nadella speaking with conviction. He looks directly into the camera, establishing a personal connection. The background is slightly out of focus, perhaps a modern office or stage setting.

**125.04 --> 125.78: "committed to"**
The camera slowly pushes in, tightening the shot on his face to emphasize his serious expression and focus. As he says "committed," cut to a quick, symbolic shot of hands firmly gripping a railing or two hands clasping together in a pact.

**125.78 --> 126.58: "doing everything"**
A dynamic montage begins, rapidly cutting between a series of shots that build in scale:
*   **"doing"**: A shot of a diverse team of Microsoft engineers collaborating intensely around a whiteboard covered in diagrams.
*   A shot of a programmer's hands typing code quickly across a screen.
*   **"everything"**: A sweeping drone shot over a massive Azure data center.
*   A doctor using a HoloLens during a medical procedure.
*   A child in a remote classroom interacting with a lesson on a Surface device.
*   The final shot is a wide, epic view of the Earth from space, with glowing digital lines connecting continents, symbolizing Microsoft's global impact and reach.
