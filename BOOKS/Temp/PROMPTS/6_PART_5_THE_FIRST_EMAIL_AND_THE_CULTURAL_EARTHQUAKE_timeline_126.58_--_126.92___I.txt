1. (0.00 - 9.12) - A 3D/2D parallax image of a single male silhouette standing on a stage under a single spotlight. His head is slightly bowed, conveying a moment of introspection and apology. The background is a dark, abstract representation of an audience.

2. (9.12 - 15.62) - A parallax scene where a central male silhouette stands before a group of other silhouettes. A glowing, stylized brain icon with gears turning inside it hovers above the central silhouette's head, representing the "learn-it-all" culture he is demonstrating.

3. (15.62 - 20.76) - A 2D/3D parallax image showing a male silhouette in the foreground. From this silhouette, a powerful, glowing signal, like a ripple in water, expands outwards across a vast, stylized network connecting hundreds of other smaller silhouettes in the background, symbolizing the message spreading through the company.

4. (20.76 - 25.40) - A close-up parallax shot of a male silhouette wearing a simple, stylized crown. The crown has a visible, small crack in it, symbolizing imperfection. The silhouette's posture is humble and open, not regal or defensive, showing it's okay for a leader to admit fault.

5. (25.40 - 27.16) - A 3D parallax scene of a line of male silhouettes walking up a gentle, ascending path toward a bright, stylized sunrise. The lead silhouette is at the front, but all are moving together, symbolizing the beginning of a positive change and a new direction.
