**0.00 - 15.32:** A split screen. On one side, an old, dusty sign reads "The Microsoft Way," which then shatters. On the other side, a close-up on Satya Nadella's determined face, looking toward the future.

**16.00 - 23.48:** A dark, metaphorical scene of a shambling zombie with a classic Nokia phone for a head, draining the light and energy from a glowing Microsoft logo.

**24.08 - 32.60:** A dramatic close-up of a hand, belonging to Nadella, decisively striking through a complex document titled "Nokia Acquisition Agreement" with a thick red pen. The words "WRITE-OFF" are stamped over it.

**33.02 - 39.28:** A financial news channel graphic fills the screen. The Microsoft stock symbol (MSFT) is shown next to a massive, blinking red number: "-$7.6 BILLION CHARGE."

**39.84 - 50.16:** Nadella stands alone on a vast, dark stage under a single spotlight. Projected on the giant screen behind him are the words: "WE WERE WRONG."

**50.58 - 59.06:** A rapid montage: Nadella standing resolute, then an image of a shattered Nokia phone, followed by the text "STRATEGY: OVER" appearing in bold letters.

**59.80 - 67.00:** A somber, slow-motion shot panning across rows of empty office desks. On one desk sits a lone, outdated Nokia Windows phone. The scene is desaturated, almost black and white.

**67.54 - 80.82:** A high-tech, abstract animation. A precise laser beam (labeled "NADEULA'S DECISION") surgically removes a dark, cancerous-looking mass (labeled "DEVICES & SERVICES STRATEGY") from a healthy, glowing brain representing Microsoft.

**81.32 - 87.32:** A visual metaphor: a hand firmly stops a cascade of dollar bills from flowing into a swirling black hole labeled "EGO."

**88.12 - 93.20:** The classic four-pane Windows logo is depicted as a giant, golden idol in the center of a temple, with employees bowing down to it.

**93.82 - 107.66:** A split screen. On the left, frustrated business users are trying to work on iPads, with a grayed-out, unavailable Microsoft Office icon. On the right, a stylized silhouette of the former CEO, Steve Ballmer, emphatically shaking his head "NO" as the word "HERESY" flashes over the screen.

**117.04 - 123.10:** An animated graphic. The words "WINDOWS FIRST" crack and crumble apart. From the dust, new words rise: "CLOUD FIRST, MOBILE FIRST," with a cloud and a smartphone icon glowing brightly.

**124.08 - 133.84:** A wide shot of Satya Nadella on stage at a press event. He is smiling, holding up an Apple iPad. The screen is brightly lit and clearly shows the Microsoft Word interface running flawlessly.

**134.46 - 139.98:** A series of quick cuts showing the shocked and stunned faces of Microsoft employees in the audience, their jaws dropped in disbelief. The audio is layered with whispers of "I can't believe it."

**140.76 - 147.72:** An animation showing the Microsoft Office logo suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) as friendly characters who jump off a Windows Surface tablet and land perfectly onto the screen of an iPad held by a happy customer.

**148.28 - 153.58:** A symbolic visual of a broken sword with the Microsoft logo on its hilt lying on the ground. Green vines and flowers begin to grow around it, symbolizing peace and new growth.

**154.26 - 163.38:** A final, powerful split-screen image. On the left, a dark, stormy scene representing the "brutal execution" of the Nokia division. On the right, a bright, welcoming scene of the Microsoft and Apple logos shaking hands, representing the "act of peace." In the center, the words "HIT REFRESH" fade in, bold and clear.
