1. CPU schematic icon, Funnel icon, Data stream arrows. Position: Center screen, Title text: "CORE PROCESSING UNIT (CPU)". Animation: Smooth transition (Wipe/Zoom) focusing on the CPU icon. Emotion: Serious, Analytical.
2. Filter icon, Wavy line smoothing into a straight line. Position: Near the CPU icon, showing data flowing *through* the filter. Animation: Morph animation where noise (static texture) dissipates into a clean signal (straight line). Emotion: Focused, Precise.
3. Data packets (small cubes), Three parallel horizontal lines diverging. Position: Left side of screen, illustrating the start of the flow path. Animation: Ripple effect as the data splits into three distinct, separate paths. Emotion: Informative.
4. Tag icon, Checkmark icon, Book/Database icon. Position: Top parallel line. Small text label: "Alpha: Metadata". Animation: Data cube hits the tag icon, explodes into smaller tags, then verifies with a quick checkmark. Emotion: Detailed.
5. Squeeze/Compress icon (arrows pushing inwards), Network symbol (globe with connecting lines). Position: Middle parallel line. Small text label: "Beta: Compression". Animation: Icon dramatically squeezes a data cube, then a speed line follows the reduced cube. Emotion: Efficiency, Speed.
6. Percentage meter (85% filled), Broken arrow (diverting path), Alert triangle. Position: Next to Channel Beta. Animation: Meter fills rapidly; if it hits 85%, an alarm flashes, and the data path breaks away downwards. Emotion: Alerting, Conditional.
7. Server rack icon, Temporary stopwatch/timer icon. Position: Bottom right section (separate visual space). Animation: The overflow arrow connects to the server rack, which pulses softly, indicating holding capacity. Emotion: Holding, Temporary state.
8. Shield icon, Clock with an offset time (asynchronous). Position: Above the server rack. Text label: "Sentinel-9". Animation: A shield icon slides over the data flow path, momentarily pausing the data stream animation beneath it. Emotion: Protective, Technical.
9. Magic wand/Fix icon, Delta symbol (Δ) with a '4'. Position: Adjacent to the error correction point. Animation: The Δ-4 icon zaps the data stream, and any visual imperfections or static disappear. Emotion: Specificity.
10. Hub/Nexus icon (central circle), Arrows merging. Position: Center of the screen, where the three parallel lines meet. Animation: All data streams smoothly flow and merge into the central hub icon. Emotion: Convergence.
11. Aligned clock faces, Gridlines snapping into place. Position: Overlaid on the hub icon. Animation: A quick animation of clock hands spinning and locking into unison (Temporal consistency effect). Emotion: Orderly.
12. Stopwatch icon, Arrow connecting the start (ingress) and the hub. Position: Below the main flow diagram. Text label: "KPI: Latency". Animation: Focus shifts to the time measurement visualization. Emotion: Critical, Measured.
13. Target icon, Digital counter display (150ms), Percentage symbol (99.9%). Position: Within the KPI section. Animation: The 150ms text pulses slightly, emphasizing the numerical goal. Emotion: Confidence.
14. Hub icon pushing data forward, Monitor/Screen icon. Position: Right side of the screen. Animation: A clean, single data stream exits the hub and moves toward the display visualization. Emotion: Forward movement.
15. Gears icon (engine), Wavy lines rendering into a complex graphic (dynamic). Position: Inside the Monitor icon. Animation: Gears turn rapidly, and the graphic on the screen continuously shifts complexity (morphing). Emotion: Adaptable, Responsive.
16. Loop/Recycle icon, Hand cursor icon pointing back to the flow. Position: Connected back from the display screen to the processing path. Animation: The loop icon glows, showing a continuous, closed feedback path. Emotion: Interactivity.
17. Slider/Dial icon, Tweak tool icon. Position: Near the feedback loop. Animation: A stylized hand icon appears and smoothly adjusts a slider, demonstrating subtle control. Emotion: Control, Precision.
18. Padlock icon, Chain link icon spanning the whole flow diagram. Position: Overlay across the entire system schematic. Animation: Padlocks appear briefly and lock at key junctions (ingress, hub, egress) along the path. Emotion: Secure, Mandatory.
19. Key icon, AES text label in bold, Dollar/Transaction icon. Position: Next to the padlock. Animation: The key icon slides into the padlock, confirming the encryption type with a visible lock snap. Emotion: Specific, High security.
20. Scroll/Ledger icon, Infinite loop icon (history trail). Position: Bottom area, separate log visualization. Animation: Tiny data points drop down into the ledger icon, which then seals shut (immutability effect). Emotion: Immutable.
21. Gavel icon (compliance), Graph/Heartbeat icon (diagnostics). Position: Next to the ledger. Animation: Both icons pulse brightly, indicating their importance and active roles. Emotion: Important, Dual purpose.
22. Three distinct icons: Double boxes (redundancy), Lightning bolt (speed), Checkmark/Scale (integrity). Position: Central summary slide. Animation: The three key icons emerge sequentially (one after the other) and stack neatly for emphasis. Emotion: Summarizing, Powerful.
23. Star/Future icon, Intertwined wave lines (entanglement), 'Phase 2' text. Position: Transition to a new, futuristic aesthetic section. Animation: A subtle, ethereal shimmer highlights the quantum entanglement concept. Emotion: Forward-looking, Aspirational.
24. Dashboard interface mockup, Calendar quarter icon (Q1/Q2/etc.). Position: Full-screen, data visualization layout. Animation: Quick wipe transition to reveal the new screen layout. Emotion: Practical, Transition.
25. Line graph with a sharp upward spike, Calendar icon pointing to 'Tuesday'. Position: Highlighted area on the dashboard graph. Animation: The spike on the line graph flashes brightly, drawing immediate visual attention. Emotion: Emphasis, Data point focus.
