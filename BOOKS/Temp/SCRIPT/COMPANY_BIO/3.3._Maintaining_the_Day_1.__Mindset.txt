Imagine you’ve just started something new – a new job, a new project, maybe even a new hobby. How do you feel on that very first day?

You’re probably full of energy, right? You’re excited, curious, eager to learn, and ready to try anything. You’re not bogged down by old rules yet, and you’re focused on the big picture and what’s possible. You’re quick to adapt. That’s the "Day 1" mindset.

Now, fast forward a few years. What happens to some companies, or even some people? They get comfortable. They start doing things "the way we've always done them." They become slow, maybe a bit resistant to change. They stop taking risks. This is what Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, calls "Day 2." And for him, Day 2 is the beginning of the end.

So, the whole idea of "Maintaining the Day 1 Mindset" is about *never* letting that initial spark die out. It’s about keeping that fresh, innovative, nimble approach, even as a company grows massive.

How do they try to do this at Amazon? It boils down to a few key things:

First, **always start with the customer.** Think of it like this: instead of building something and *then* trying to find someone to buy it, Amazon tries to imagine what the customer *needs* or *wants* first, even if the customer doesn't know it yet. Then, they work backward from that need. For example, people wanted fast delivery, so Amazon built a huge logistics network. They didn't just build the network and hope people would use it. The customer's need came first.

Second, **be wary of rules and processes taking over.** As a company grows, it builds systems and rules to keep things organized. That’s good! But sometimes, these rules become more important than the actual goal. Think of a big company where everyone just follows the rulebook, even if it doesn't make sense for the customer anymore. Bezos says, don't let the "process" become the master. Keep asking, "Is this rule still serving our customers or just making our lives easier?"

Third, **embrace new ideas from outside.** Don't get stuck in your own bubble. The world is always changing, with new technologies and new ways of doing things. Companies that ignore these trends, or think they know best, usually fall behind. Amazon, for instance, saw the internet coming, then cloud computing (which became AWS, their cloud service), and always looks at what’s next, like AI. They're always asking, "What new tool or trend can help us serve customers better?"

Finally, **make decisions quickly, and be okay with being wrong sometimes.** In a "Day 2" company, decisions can take forever. Everyone needs to agree, all information must be perfect. But in a fast-changing world, waiting for 100% certainty means you often miss opportunities. So, Amazon encourages making decisions even when you only have about 70% of the information. If it’s a wrong decision, you learn from it and fix it quickly. It’s better to be agile and course-correct than to be slow and perfect.

In essence, "Maintaining the Day 1 Mindset" is about fighting complacency. It's about staying hungry, curious, customer-focused, and willing to experiment, no matter how big or successful you become. It's about forever acting like it's your first day, full of possibility and drive.
