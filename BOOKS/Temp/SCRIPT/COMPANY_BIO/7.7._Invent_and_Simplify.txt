"Invent and Simplify" means creating new things and making them easy for everyone. Itâ€™s about solving problems in fresh ways and then making those solutions simple to use, so more people can benefit. A great example of this is Amazon Web Services, or AWS.

Before AWS, if a business needed computer power for its website, they had to spend millions, perhaps $5 million to $10 million, building their own server rooms. This was complex and expensive. Amazon invented AWS to simplify this. They let businesses rent computing power online, paying only for what they used. This cut costs dramatically, often by 30% to 60% for early users, saving them millions in infrastructure. This invention and simplification was revolutionary. Today, AWS is a huge success, generating over $90 billion in revenue for Amazon in 2023. This single idea of inventing a complex service and then simplifying its use created immense value, both for Amazon and for countless businesses worldwide, showing the powerful impact of this lesson.
