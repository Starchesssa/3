"Invent and Simplify" means first, building something truly new, not just improving what exists. Amazon famously did this with Amazon Web Services (AWS), inventing cloud computing as a service, drastically simplifying IT infrastructure for countless businesses. For you, this means don't just optimize; consider entirely new solutions.

Second, relentlessly simplify your inventions. Once you create something novel, the challenge is making it intuitive. Amazon excels here: think of their one-click ordering or the Kindle's straightforward design. They took immense technological complexity and made it astonishingly easy for customers. If your invention is hard to use, its impact will be limited. So, after you invent, scrutinize every detail to remove friction, making your groundbreaking solution effortlessly accessible.
