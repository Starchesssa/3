"Invent and Simplify" means true innovation isn't just creating something novel; it's making complex solutions elegantly easy for the customer. Amazon embodies this by relentlessly inventing, then rigorously simplifying. Consider Amazon Web Services, AWS. Its invention in 2006 wasn't just new technology; it simplified IT infrastructure, transforming capital-intensive server management into an on-demand service. This simplification propelled AWS to generate over 70% of Amazon's total operating income in recent years, despite representing only a fraction of its total revenue, clearly illustrating the massive financial impact of simplifying a complex industry. Another prime example is Amazonâ€™s patented 1-Click ordering. This invention dramatically simplified the checkout process. Industry studies indicate that removing friction and simplifying steps can increase e-commerce conversion rates by 5% to 10%, translating into billions of dollars in additional sales for Amazon annually by making buying effortless. This dedication to inventing and then simplifying has been foundational to Amazon's growth and customer loyalty.
