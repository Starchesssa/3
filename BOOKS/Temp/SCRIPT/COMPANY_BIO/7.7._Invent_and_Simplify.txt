Invent and Simplify means to create new things and make hard things easy. Amazon did this with Amazon Web Services, known as AWS. Before AWS, starting an internet company was very expensive. A new company might spend 500,000 dollars on computer servers before making one dollar. Amazon invented a solution. It rented its own powerful computers to others by the hour. This simplified the process to just a few clicks. The startup cost for technology dropped by over 90 percent for many new businesses. This invention was a massive success. In the year 2023, AWS generated 90.8 billion dollars in revenue. But the truly shocking number is its profit contribution. Amazon's total operating profit for that year was 36.9 billion dollars. AWS alone provided 24.6 billion dollars of that profit. This single invention accounted for 67 percent of Amazon's entire profit for the year. This one idea, born from simplifying a complex problem, became the company's financial engine.
