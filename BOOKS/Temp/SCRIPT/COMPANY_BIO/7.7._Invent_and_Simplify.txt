"Invent and Simplify" teaches us the power of creating new solutions while making them elegantly easy to use. Consider Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Amazon didn't just invent cloud computing; they profoundly simplified the complex task of managing IT infrastructure for businesses globally. Before AWS, companies faced massive capital expenditures and operational complexities for servers and data centers. By offering compute power, storage, and databases as simplified, on-demand services, AWS revolutionized an entire industry.

This combination of invention and simplification paid off immensely. Launched in 2006, by Q3 2023, AWS alone generated an impressive $23.1 billion in revenue, representing over 70% of Amazon's total operating income. This highlights how simplifying a complex problem can lead to exponential growth and market dominance. For you, this means not only brainstorming novel ideas but relentlessly refining them to their simplest, most accessible form. A brilliant invention thatâ€™s too complicated to use will struggle to achieve even 1% of its potential impact. Strive to invent, but simplify relentlessly to unlock true value.
