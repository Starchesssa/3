Amazon always pushed to invent. Think about AWS, Amazon Web Services. Internally, Amazon needed scalable computing power for its own website. Instead of just solving their problem, they invented a whole new business. They packaged these internal tools—servers, storage, databases—and offered them to anyone else. It was a groundbreaking invention that fundamentally changed cloud computing, becoming a massive revenue stream. But inventing wasn't enough; they also had to simplify. Take the famous "one-click" ordering. This patent streamlined the online checkout process from multiple steps down to just one click. It simplified the customer experience dramatically, reducing friction and making buying effortless. This dual focus—creating new possibilities and making them effortlessly accessible—has been a core part of Amazon’s DNA, showing that true innovation often lies in both the breakthrough and its elegant execution.
