"Invent and Simplify" means constantly looking for new ways to do things while making them easier. Amazon famously did this with Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Internally, Amazon struggled with managing its own scaling infrastructure. Instead of just fixing it for themselves, they invented a revolutionary solution: packaging their internal computing power and selling it as a service. This was a huge invention.

But the simplification part was critical. They took incredibly complex IT infrastructure – servers, storage, databases – and simplified access to it for millions. Startups no longer needed to buy expensive hardware; they could just rent what they needed with a few clicks. This didn't just simplify Amazon's operations; it simplified the *entire tech industry*.

The impact was immense. AWS is now a multi-billion-dollar business that powers most of the internet. So, what can you learn? Don't just chase novelty. Ask yourself: "Does this invention genuinely simplify a problem? Is it making something complex, easy?" If your innovation creates more complexity, like the Fire Phone's overly complicated interface, it often fails. Focus on inventions that elegantly simplify. This is how you create lasting value.
