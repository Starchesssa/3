Amazon teaches us the dual power of 'Invent and Simplify'. This means not just following existing paths, but daring to create entirely new solutions. Think about how they constantly reimagined everything from online shopping to cloud computing.

But inventing isn't enough. Once you create something new, your relentless focus must shift to making it unbelievably simple. Ask yourself: how can you strip away complexity? How can you make it intuitive for your customers and efficient for your team?

Complexity often becomes a barrier. By constantly inventing new ways and then simplifying them to their core, you remove friction. This approach encourages your team to be pioneers and ensures your innovations are embraced, not abandoned because they're too hard to understand or use. Always invent, then simplify.
