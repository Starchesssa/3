Invent and Simplify means creating new things and making hard things easy. Imagine building a complex machine. Then imagine making that machine work with just one button. That is Invent and Simplify. Amazon did this with Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Before AWS, companies had to buy their own computer servers, costing millions. This was a huge problem for small businesses. Amazon invented a solution. They let companies rent computer power over the internet. This simplified the entire process. A company could start with just a few dollars. The impact was enormous. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Amazon's total company operating profit was 3.5 billion dollars. AWS alone made 5.3 billion dollars in operating profit in that same time. This one invention made up more than 150 percent of the company's total profit. It covered all the losses from other parts of the business. This shows how one new, simple idea can become the most important part of a giant company.
