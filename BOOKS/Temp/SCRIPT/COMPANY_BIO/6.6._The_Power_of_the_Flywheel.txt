The Power of the Flywheel explains how a business can create a self-reinforcing cycle where each positive action makes the next one stronger, causing rapid growth. Think of a heavy wheel: once you get it spinning, it gathers momentum, making it easier to spin faster and faster.

For Amazon, this cycle often starts with lower prices. Lower prices attract more customers. As more customers shop, Amazon achieves higher sales volume. This increased volume allows Amazon to buy products in larger quantities and run its operations more efficiently, significantly reducing its costs. For instance, a 15% increase in customer base might reduce unit costs by 5%, which then allows Amazon to offer even lower prices. These further price reductions attract even more customers, making the "flywheel" spin faster. This continuous loop means that small, consistent improvements in one area, like reducing fulfillment costs by 2% year-over-year, can lead to a 10% annual increase in new customer acquisition, creating a multiplying effect on growth and profitability over time.
