The Power of the Flywheel explains how a virtuous cycle, once started, builds incredible momentum. Amazon's genius was identifying its own. They realized that lower prices would attract more customers. More customers meant higher sales volume, which then attracted more third-party sellers to their platform. This increased selection further improved the customer experience. This scale allowed Amazon to lower its operating costs, which in turn enabled them to offer even lower prices, completing the loop. Each turn made the next easier and more powerful.

For your business, consider what your own flywheel looks like. What positive actions in your company naturally reinforce each other, creating a compounding effect? Don't look for a single big bang, but a series of interconnected improvements that feed into one another. Start by identifying your core customer value and how you can continuously improve it in a way that generates momentum, rather than requiring constant external pushes. This consistent, self-reinforcing growth is incredibly powerful.
