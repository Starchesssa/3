The Power of the Flywheel is all about creating a self-reinforcing cycle. Amazon realized that a virtuous loop could drive incredible momentum. Their model started with lower prices, which attracted more customer visits. More visits meant more sellers joined, expanding their selection. This improved the overall customer experience, leading to more growth, economies of scale, and the ability to offer even lower prices – completing the loop and strengthening the next spin.

Think about your own business. What are the interconnected actions where success in one area naturally propels the next? Identify these critical steps. By intentionally designing and nurturing your own flywheel, you can build a powerful system where each positive effort compounds, creating unstoppable momentum and sustainable growth for your company. Don’t just work, make your successes fuel each other.
