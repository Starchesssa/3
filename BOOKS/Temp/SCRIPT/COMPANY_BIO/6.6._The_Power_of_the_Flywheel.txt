Imagine pushing a huge, heavy wheel. The first push is very hard. Each new push makes it spin a little faster. Soon, the wheel's own weight helps it spin with great force. This is Amazon's flywheel concept. It starts with lower prices for customers. Lower prices bring in more shoppers. More shoppers attract more sellers to Amazon's platform. More sellers create a wider selection of products. A better selection brings in even more customers. This cycle made Amazon grow very fast. For instance, Amazon Prime was a big push on the wheel. In 2015, there were about 54 million Prime members. By 2020, that number grew over 270 percent to more than 200 million members. Prime members spend on average $1,400 per year, compared to just $600 for non-members. That is more than double the spending. This one push made the entire business spin much, much faster.
