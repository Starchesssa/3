The Power of the Flywheel illustrates how interconnected positive actions create self-reinforcing loops, generating powerful momentum. Amazonâ€™s core flywheel begins with low prices. This attracts more customer visits, which in turn entices more third-party sellers to join the platform. The increased volume from both customers and sellers grants Amazon greater scale, enabling lower operating costs. These cost savings are then reinvested into further lowering prices, completing the cycle and accelerating the entire system.

This isn't about a single big win; it's about compounding small advantages. For instance, Amazon's gross merchandise sales from third-party sellers grew from just 3% in 1999 to over 60% by 2018, significantly reducing their own inventory risk and boosting profitability, allowing deeper price cuts. You should identify these virtuous cycles in your own business. What consistent efforts will build momentum, where each success fuels the next, causing your growth to compound exponentially?
