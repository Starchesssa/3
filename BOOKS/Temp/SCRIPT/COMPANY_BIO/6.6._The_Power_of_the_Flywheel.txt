Imagine a giant, heavy wheel. It takes a lot of effort to start it spinning. But each push makes it go a little faster. Soon, its own momentum helps it turn. This is the flywheel idea. Amazon's flywheel starts with lower prices. Lower prices attract more customers. More customers mean more third-party sellers want to use the site. This leads to a bigger selection of products. Better selection and low prices bring in even more customers. The wheel spins faster and faster.

A great example is Amazon Prime, launched in 2005. It was a big risk. In 2017, a study showed Prime members spent an average of $1,300 per year. Non-members spent around $700. This is an 86 percent increase in spending per customer. This extra cash flow was a massive push on the flywheel. Amazon used this money to improve its delivery network and lower its cost structure. This allowed them to lower prices even more. Each part of the business pushes the next, creating unstoppable growth.
