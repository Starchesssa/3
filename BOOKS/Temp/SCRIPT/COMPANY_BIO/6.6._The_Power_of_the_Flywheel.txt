The Power of the Flywheel is about creating a self-reinforcing loop, where each positive action builds momentum for the next. For Amazon, a prime example is their core retail strategy. It began with offering lower prices, which naturally attracted more customers. With more customers, Amazon gained the volume to reduce operating costs and also became more attractive to third-party sellers, expanding their product selection significantly. This wider selection and better customer experience then drew in even more customers. The increased scale and efficiency from this larger customer base allowed Amazon to further lower its costs, enabling them to offer even lower prices. See how each component feeds the next, creating a powerful, compounding effect? Itâ€™s a success story built not on a single breakthrough, but on consistently turning this wheel. For you, consider your own goals or business. What are the key elements that, if improved, will naturally enhance others and create a virtuous cycle? Identify your own flywheel and commit to pushing it, understanding that consistent effort builds unstoppable momentum over time.
