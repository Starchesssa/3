Jeff Bezos understood that true growth wasn't linear; it was a powerful, self-reinforcing loop. He famously sketched his idea on a napkin, illustrating what became known as the Amazon Flywheel. The core idea was simple yet brilliant: lower prices attract more customers. More customers increase scale, allowing Amazon to lower its cost structure further, which in turn enables even lower prices. This virtuous cycle doesn't stop there. More customers also attract third-party sellers to the platform, expanding selection dramatically. A wider selection then further improves the customer experience, drawing in even more people. This constant feedback loop, where each component strengthens the others, became the core engine of Amazon's explosive success, ensuring continuous momentum and growth.
