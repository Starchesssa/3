Imagine a giant, heavy metal wheel. The first push is incredibly hard. But with each push, it gets a little easier to spin. Soon, its own momentum helps it turn faster and faster. This is Amazon's "flywheel."

It all starts with lower prices. Lower prices bring in more customers. More customers attract more sellers to Amazon's website. For example, in 1999, only 3% of items sold on Amazon were from outside sellers. By 2018, that number soared to 58%.

This flood of sellers creates more selection, which brings in even more customers. With so many people buying, Amazon grows bigger and can lower its operating costs. For instance, Amazon Web Services, their cloud computing business, generated over $25 billion in revenue in 2018, with an operating margin of nearly 28%. This massive profit was then used to lower prices on the retail side even more.

Lower prices attract more customers, and the wheel spins faster. Each part of the business pushes the next, creating a powerful, unstoppable momentum that requires less and less effort to maintain.
