At Amazon, decisions weren't about waiting for 100% certainty, but about moving with conviction, even in ambiguity. One core principle was distinguishing between "Type 1" and "Type 2" decisions. A Type 1 decision was irreversible, like launching a massive, new fulfillment center – something you could only do once, so it required careful, deliberate thought. But most decisions were "Type 2" – reversible. These could be made quickly, and if they didn't work, you could simply reverse course with minimal damage. This philosophy allowed teams to experiment constantly, iterating rapidly on website features, product listings, and service offerings, learning from each step without being paralyzed by fear of failure.

This agility was also fueled by the "Disagree and Commit" principle. Jeff Bezos encouraged fierce debate, wanting his leaders to challenge ideas rigorously, even his own. A famous example came with the decision to open Amazon’s marketplace to third-party sellers. Many within the company strongly believed this would hurt Amazon’s own retail business, fearing direct competition on their platform. The internal arguments were intense. Yet, once Bezos made the final call, stating his conviction that it would expand customer selection and be a long-term win, the dissenters were expected to fully commit and execute the plan with all their might. And they did, transforming Amazon into the vast marketplace we know today.

Leadership meetings at Amazon were unique. Instead of PowerPoint presentations, every meeting began with 30 minutes of quiet reading. Teams were required to write detailed "narrative memos"—often six pages long—explaining their proposals, their rationale, and anticipating potential challenges. This rigorous process forced leaders to think deeply and communicate clearly, rather than relying on bullet points. It was a direct application of their bias for action, ensuring decisions were well-considered but also moved forward efficiently. This deliberate act of quiet reading before discussion ensured everyone came to the table with a shared, deep understanding of the topic, leading to more productive and higher-quality decisions.

This bias for action was evident in Amazon Web Services, or AWS. It wasn’t perfect when it launched, but it was rolled out, then iterated and improved upon at an incredible pace, responding to developer needs. Bezos understood that speed was often more important than perfection. They adopted a mindset of "invent, launch, iterate" – getting a product or service out quickly, learning from customer feedback, and then refining it. This approach minimized the risk of waiting too long and missing an opportunity, allowing Amazon to dominate new markets.

Ultimately, every decision, from the smallest website tweak to the largest strategic pivot, was filtered through one lens: customer obsession. When developing the Kindle, the focus wasn't on inventing a gadget, but on solving the customer problem of buying, carrying, and reading books digitally. When creating Amazon Prime, it wasn’t about a shipping program; it was about delighting customers with speed, convenience, and a bundle of valuable services. These principles of decision-making and leadership weren't just theoretical; they were lived every day, shaping the very fabric of how Amazon operated, growing from an online bookseller into a global behemoth that continually innovates on behalf of its customers.
