"Frugality Fuels Innovation" means that having limited resources isn't a problem; it's a powerful way to spark new ideas and invent solutions. When money or tools are scarce, people are forced to be incredibly creative, finding clever, low-cost ways to solve challenges, which drives true innovation.

Consider Amazonâ€™s famous door desks. Instead of buying expensive office furniture, early employees, including Jeff Bezos, used simple wooden doors on top of four-by-four posts. A typical office desk might cost $500, but these door desks cost around $50, a 90% saving per workstation. If Amazon saved this $450 per desk across thousands of early employees, it meant millions of dollars were available to invest directly into customer-facing technology or lower product prices, rather than lavish offices.

Another key example is the very creation of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon needed to build and manage its own massive computing infrastructure as cheaply and efficiently as possible. This internal need for frugality pushed them to develop highly scalable, cost-effective cloud services. This innovation, born from a drive to reduce internal costs, became AWS, which alone generated over $90 billion in revenue in 2023. Here, frugality didn't just save money; it created a massive, world-changing new business.
