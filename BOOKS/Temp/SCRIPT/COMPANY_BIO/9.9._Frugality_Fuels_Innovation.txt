Chapter 9, 'Frugality Fuels Innovation,' teaches a powerful lesson: constraints can actually spark creativity. Amazon wasn't always about massive budgets; they embraced frugality, not as a limitation, but as a catalyst for new ideas.

Think about it this way: when you have fewer resources, you're forced to be more resourceful. Instead of just buying a solution, you innovate. This company found that having less made them invent simpler, more efficient, and often more impactful solutions.

For your team, this means not seeing budget cuts or limited resources as obstacles, but as exciting challenges. How can you achieve the same, or even better, results with less? This mindset pushes for clever problem-solving, encourages inventive thinking, and can lead to surprisingly effective breakthroughs that wouldn't have emerged if money was no object. Itâ€™s about being lean and smart, driving innovation through necessity.
