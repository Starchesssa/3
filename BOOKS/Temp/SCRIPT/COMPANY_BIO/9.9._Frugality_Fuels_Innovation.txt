Frugality isn’t about being cheap; it's about resourcefulness – achieving more with less. Amazon operates on this principle, believing constraints ignite innovation. Instead of automatically buying new, they challenge teams to creatively optimize existing resources. Take Amazon Web Services, or AWS. It grew from externalizing Amazon’s own internal infrastructure, not from massive, new upfront capital. This innovation enabled countless startups to launch with dramatically reduced costs. Historically, setting up server infrastructure could cost hundreds of thousands, even millions. With AWS, a startup could begin for a few hundred dollars monthly, slashing initial capital expenditure by over 99%. This freed founders to innovate rapidly.

This approach applies to you, too. Scrutinize your resource allocation. Could a 15% reduction in non-essential spending free up funds to boost your core product development by 20%? Remember, every dollar saved through cleverness is a dollar available for true innovation, allowing you to experiment more frequently and learn faster, ultimately accelerating your path to success.
