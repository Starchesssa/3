Frugality means doing more with less money. It is not about being cheap. It is about finding clever solutions without big budgets. This forces people to be more creative. In the early days, the company needed desks for its employees. A normal office desk cost about 600 dollars in 1995. Instead of buying them, the company bought simple wooden doors for less than 60 dollars each. This represented a 90 percent cost saving per desk. They attached legs and created what they called a door desk. This small act saved nearly 8 percent of their initial operating budget that year. That money was instead used to lower book prices by an average of 3 percent, which directly boosted customer orders. When a major competitor went bankrupt in 2001, it was revealed their office spending was 1500 percent higher than our company's per employee. This showed that spending less on non-essentials directly fueled innovation and competitive pricing for the customer. Constraints make you resourceful.
