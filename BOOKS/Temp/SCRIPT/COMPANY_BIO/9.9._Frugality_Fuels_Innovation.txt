Frugality means doing more with less. It forces you to be creative with limited resources. In the early days, Amazon couldn't afford expensive office desks. A standard desk cost about $500. So Jeff Bezos bought wooden doors and legs for just $60 each. This simple idea saved the company 88 percent on every single desk. That money went into things that mattered for customers, not fancy furniture.

This mindset led to Amazon's biggest innovation. The company needed to run its website without spending billions on computer systems. They built their own efficient, low-cost solution. This internal project was so successful they offered it to other companies. It was named Amazon Web Services, or AWS. In 2023, AWS generated over $90.8 billion in revenue. This one idea, born from the need to save money, now contributes over 60 percent of Amazon's entire operating profit. Having less money forces you to think. It makes you invent your way out of a problem.
