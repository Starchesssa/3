"Frugality Fuels Innovation" sounds simple, but it’s a core Amazon principle. It’s not about being cheap; it’s about resourceful problem-solving with limited means. When resources are constrained, you're forced to think outside the box and find creative solutions.

Amazon famously started with desks made from old doors. This wasn't just to save money, it instilled a mindset: how can we achieve our goals efficiently with what we have? This forced them to invent. Instead of spending endlessly, they developed clever, often digital, solutions like their early review system or optimizing warehouse processes.

For you, this means seeing limitations not as roadblocks, but as catalysts. When faced with a tight budget or scarce resources, don’t immediately seek more. Instead, ask yourself: "How can I achieve this differently, smarter, or more efficiently with what's available?" This pressure can spark groundbreaking ideas that wouldn't emerge with unlimited resources. It forces invention.
