Amazon's journey teaches us the profound value of looking beyond immediate gains. While Wall Street often demanded quick profits, Jeff Bezos famously focused on the long-term, sometimes willing to be misunderstood for years. A perfect example is Amazon Web Services, or AWS. In the early 2000s, Amazon began building a massive cloud computing infrastructure. Many wondered why an online retailer was pouring billions into servers and data centers. It was a colossal bet on a future where businesses would rely on outsourced computing power. It took years for AWS to truly blossom and become profitable, requiring immense patience and investment. Yet, Amazon persisted. Today, AWS is a multi-billion-dollar industry leader, demonstrating how embracing a patient, long-term vision can transform a speculative venture into an indispensable, core pillar of a global company.
