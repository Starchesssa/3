Amazon famously makes decisions with a multi-year horizon, often looking five or ten years ahead. They were willing to invest in projects like AWS for over a decade before it became a massive success, even when it wasn't immediately profitable or understood by outsiders. This lesson teaches us that *you* should also think beyond immediate gains. Don't be afraid to plant seeds today for something that might take years to grow into a forest. Short-term thinking can lead to chasing quick wins and missing out on truly transformative opportunities. Instead, ask: what could your company achieve in five or ten years if you started building towards it *now*? This long-term perspective allows for bolder, more innovative projects, even if it means enduring some initial doubt or criticism.
