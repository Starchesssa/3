Imagine you can have one cookie right now, or a whole box of cookies in five years. Amazon always chooses the box of cookies. This is long-term thinking: you accept pain today for a much bigger reward later.

A perfect, and shocking, example was the dot-com crash. Between 1999 and 2001, Amazon’s stock price completely collapsed. It plummeted from a high of $107 per share down to just $6 per share. That’s a devastating 94% drop. Most companies would have fired people and stopped all new projects to save money.

But Amazon did the opposite. While its value was disappearing, it spent hundreds of millions of dollars building a network of massive warehouses. Wall Street thought this was crazy, predicting bankruptcy. But this was a seven-year plan.

Years later, this network allowed Amazon to deliver products faster and cheaper than anyone else. That painful 94% stock crash was the short-term price they paid to build the foundation of their entire global empire. They chose the box of cookies, and it made all the difference.
