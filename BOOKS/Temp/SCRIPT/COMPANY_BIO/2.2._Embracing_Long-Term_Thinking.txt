Long-term thinking means planting a seed today for a tree you will sit under in ten years. Amazon used this idea to become a giant. For many years, Amazon made almost no profit. This was a choice. During the dot-com stock market crash, Amazon's stock price fell by over 90 percent. It dropped from a high of $107 per share in 1999 to below $6 per share in 2001. People thought Amazon would fail completely. They wanted Amazon to stop spending and show a profit immediately. Instead, Jeff Bezos invested even more money into the company's future. He spent hundreds of millions on new warehouses and better technology. The company did not report its first full profitable year until the end of 2003. That was six years after it became a public company. This focus on the distant future, not immediate results, allowed them to build a massive foundation. They gave up small profits then for huge dominance later.
