Embracing long-term thinking means making decisions today that might not yield immediate returns but unlock significant value years down the line. Amazon masterfully demonstrates this with initiatives like Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Launched in 2006, AWS required immense upfront investment, appearing to be a costly venture for years. Short-term analysts likely saw this as a drag on profitability, potentially causing minor stock dips of 1-3% during its early, resource-intensive phase.

However, Amazon stuck to its vision. By 2023, AWS alone generated approximately $90.8 billion in revenue, becoming a colossal profit engine for the company. This isn't just a success story; it's a critical lesson for you. Imagine if they had scrapped AWS due to a 5% dip in quarterly profits during its early, expensive years. The missed opportunity would be staggering. You should evaluate decisions not just on next quarter's report, but on their potential to drive 10x or 100x growth over a decade. Don't let a momentary 2% stock fluctuation deter you from building something truly transformative that requires a longer horizon.
