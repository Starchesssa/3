Embracing long-term thinking means choosing a big prize far in the future over a small prize today. It means you are willing to look unpopular for a while to win big later on. Amazon mastered this with its cloud computing service, Amazon Web Services or AWS. For almost 10 years, Amazon invested billions of dollars into building AWS. Wall Street was confused and often punished the company. Investors saw this spending drag down profits from the main retail business. In one quarter in 2014, the company's massive spending caused its stock to drop by 10 percent after an earnings report. But Amazon ignored the short-term noise. By 2015, when they finally revealed the numbers, AWS was already a business making over 1.5 billion dollars in revenue every three months. Today, AWS is the profit engine of the entire company. It is responsible for over 70 percent of Amazon's total operating income. This single long-term bet, which caused short-term pain for years, now financially supports the entire company.
