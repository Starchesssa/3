Embracing long-term thinking means building for years, not just quarters. Amazon is a master of this. Think about AWS: for years, it was a massive investment with no clear immediate profit, yet Bezos saw its future. He committed, knowing the payoff was distant but transformative. The same goes for Prime. Initially, free shipping for a yearly fee seemed crazy to investors, but it built incredible long-term customer loyalty and engagement.

For you, this means resisting the urge for quick wins. Are you making choices that will still benefit you five or ten years down the line? Don't abandon projects too soon just because they don't show instant results. Instead, identify foundational investments, like Amazon did with its infrastructure or customer experience, and stick with them, even when it’s hard or the path isn’t perfectly clear. This long-term perspective is crucial for truly impactful innovation and growth.
