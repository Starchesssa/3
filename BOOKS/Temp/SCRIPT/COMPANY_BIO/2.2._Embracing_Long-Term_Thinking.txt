Embracing long-term thinking means looking beyond immediate profits to invest in the future. Amazon famously demonstrated this with **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. In the early 2000s, when Amazon was primarily an online retailer, they began building out their internal infrastructure. Instead of keeping this solely for themselves, they had the foresight to offer these services to other businesses. Many questioned why a retailer was getting into cloud computing; it was a massive, expensive undertaking with no guaranteed short-term returns. But Bezos saw the potential for a new, fundamental utility. This wasn't about quick wins; it was about building a foundational business for decades. Amazon invested heavily, sometimes for years without significant profit, allowing AWS to grow into a multi-billion dollar segment that now powers countless companies. Similarly, **Amazon Prime** initially looked like a money-loser with its free two-day shipping, but it locked in long-term customer loyalty and increased overall purchasing.

What you should take from this is the courage to plant seeds today that may not bear fruit for years. Don't be swayed by short-term metrics or doubters when you have a clear, long-term vision. Just as Amazon invested in these ventures, you should identify areas where a sustained investment can create disproportionate value in the future, even if it feels challenging now. Think about enduring value, not just instant gratification.
