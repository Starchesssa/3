Imagine you’re building something from scratch. Most people start by thinking, "What can I build?" or "What are my competitors doing?" But Amazon, especially in its early days, had a totally different approach.

Their secret, right from the very beginning, was something called "Customer Obsession."

Now, this isn't just about good customer service, like being polite on the phone. It’s much, much deeper. Think of it like this: instead of looking at what everyone else is doing, or trying to invent a cool gadget just because you can, Amazon starts every single idea by asking one simple question: "What does the customer *need*?"

They then work backward from that need.

Let’s break that down. Most companies might say, "We have this cool technology, what can we make with it?" Amazon flips that. They say, "What problem does the customer have? How can we solve it for them, even if it means inventing something completely new or doing something really difficult?"

Here are some simple examples of how this "customer obsession" plays out:

Remember when online shopping first started? People hated waiting for packages and paying high shipping fees. Amazon didn't just offer slightly cheaper shipping. They launched things like "Free Super Saver Shipping." They took a hit on their profits in the short term, but they knew customers wanted it, and it built massive trust and loyalty over time. That’s working backward from the customer’s desire for free shipping.

Another one: customer reviews. Buying online meant you couldn’t touch or see a product. Customers were worried. So, Amazon made it super easy for *anyone* to write reviews, good or bad. They trusted their customers. This wasn't about selling more stuff immediately; it was about giving customers the information they needed to feel confident buying.

Think about the Kindle. People loved books, but carrying a bunch around was heavy. They wanted instant access to thousands of titles. Amazon didn't just make an e-reader; they built a whole system around it so you could buy a book and start reading it in seconds. They solved a customer pain point: convenience and access.

Even something like "One-Click Ordering." People found checkout processes annoying and long. Amazon said, "How can we make this incredibly simple?" And boom, one-click. It dramatically simplified buying for the customer.

So, "Customer Obsession" for Amazon means constantly thinking about the customer, almost to an extreme degree. It means always asking: "What makes their life easier? What makes them happier? What problem can we solve for them?" And then, no matter how hard it is, building the solution. It’s about putting the customer’s needs at the absolute center of everything you do, and building your entire company around making *them* happy, even if it means doing things differently or taking risks.
