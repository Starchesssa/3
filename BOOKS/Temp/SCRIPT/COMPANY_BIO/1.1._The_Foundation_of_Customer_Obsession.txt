From the very beginning, when Jeff Bezos first envisioned what would become Amazon, one principle stood above all others: customer obsession. It wasn't just a nice idea; it was the absolute foundation, the very first brick laid in the company's structure. Bezos believed that if you started with the customer and worked backward, truly understanding their needs and desires, then everything else – innovation, growth, profitability – would naturally follow.

Picture this: It's the mid-1990s. The internet is new, and buying things online is a foreign concept to most. Bezos chose books, a familiar product, but decided to offer an unprecedented selection, far more than any physical store could hold. This was an early demonstration of customer obsession – giving customers something they couldn't get anywhere else, a vast ocean of choice delivered to their door.

But it went deeper than selection. Amazon quickly introduced features that were revolutionary for their time, all driven by the customer. Take customer reviews, for instance. Before Amazon, you relied on professional critics. But Amazon empowered every single buyer to share their opinion, good or bad. This built incredible trust. It showed that Amazon wasn't afraid to let customers speak freely, even if it meant a negative review. They understood that honest feedback, from fellow customers, was invaluable.

Bezos even had a memorable way of reinforcing this focus: in early meetings, he'd often leave one chair empty. He'd tell his team, "That's the most important person in the room: the customer." It was a constant, physical reminder that every decision, every product, every policy should be made with the customer's best interest at heart.

This obsession meant relentlessly focusing on things like low prices, convenience, and a hassle-free experience. When the "one-click" ordering system was patented, it wasn't just a clever tech trick; it was designed to make buying incredibly simple and fast for the customer. If a customer had a problem, Amazon aimed to make returns easy, refunds quick, and service prompt. They understood that a bad experience, even a small one, could erode trust, and trust was the most valuable asset they could build.

This deep, unwavering commitment to the customer, listening to them, anticipating their needs, and striving to make their lives better and easier, was the bedrock upon which Amazon was built. It was the driving force behind every early decision and the enduring philosophy that guided its growth.
