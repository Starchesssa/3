Amazon's journey wasn't just about selling things; it was built on a radical idea: obsessing over the customer. From the very beginning, Jeff Bezos envisioned Amazon not merely as an online bookstore, but as "Earth's most customer-centric company." This wasn't just a catchy slogan; it was a deep-seated philosophy that guided every decision.

One famous anecdote illustrates this perfectly: in early Amazon meetings, Jeff Bezos would often place an empty chair in the room. He explained that this chair represented the most important person in the room – the customer. Every discussion, every product idea, every strategic choice, had to be viewed through the lens of that absent, yet ever-present, customer. It was a constant, visual reminder to put their needs above all else.

This obsession manifested in tangible ways. Amazon wasn't afraid to embrace things that seemed counter-intuitive for a retailer. For instance, allowing negative product reviews. Traditional stores would never highlight flaws, but Amazon understood that honest feedback, even critical, built trust with customers. They believed that providing the full picture, warts and all, empowered customers to make better decisions, fostering loyalty in the long run.

Similarly, they championed features like "One-Click Ordering" – a simple innovation designed purely for customer convenience, making purchases effortless. When contemplating "Free Super Saver Shipping," there was internal debate about the cost. Yet, the overwhelming customer desire for it outweighed internal concerns, leading to a program that became a cornerstone of their offering and drove immense customer adoption.

Another pivotal moment came with the decision to invite third-party sellers onto the Amazon platform, creating the Marketplace. This was a revolutionary move. Instead of solely selling their *own* products, Amazon opened its virtual doors to competitors. Why? Because customers wanted wider selection and competitive pricing. Bezos realized that by empowering other businesses to sell on Amazon, they were ultimately serving the customer's desire for choice, even if it meant less control over every transaction. This commitment to customer-centricity, even when it meant disrupting their own established practices, proved to be a powerful engine for growth and customer loyalty. It cemented the idea that Amazon existed to serve the customer, not the other way around.
