The year is 2014.
A giant is slumbering.
Worse than slumbering.
A giant is dying.
This giant was once the undisputed king of the world.
Its name was Microsoft.
It had placed a computer on every desk and in every home.
It had built an empire on the foundations of its operating system.
An empire named Windows.
But the world had changed.
The ground had shifted beneath its feet.
A new era had dawned.
An era of mobile phones.
An era of cloud computing.
An era of interconnected devices that lived in your pocket.
And in this new world.
The giant was lost.
It was a leviathan from a bygone age.
Its movements were slow.
Its vision was clouded.
It was fighting yesterday's wars.
Apple had redefined the consumer experience with the iPhone.
Google owned the world of search and mobile with Android.
Amazon was quietly building a new kind of empire in the clouds with AWS.
And Microsoft.
Microsoft was releasing the Zune.
It was pushing a mobile operating system that nobody wanted.
It was trapped in a fortress of its own making.
The fortress of Windows.
The company culture had become toxic.
It was a gladiator pit of warring divisions.
The infamous stack ranking system forced employees to compete against each other.
Not against the competition.
Innovation was stifled.
Brilliant ideas died in the boardrooms of middle managers.
The company that once defined the future now seemed destined to become a relic of the past.
The market knew it.
The press knew it.
The employees knew it.
The company had lost its way.
It had lost its soul.
Then.
A change.
The long-reigning CEO, Steve Ballmer, a man of immense passion and energy, announced his departure.
The search for a successor began.
The world watched.
Who could possibly steer this sinking ship.
Who could turn this behemoth around.
The board looked at outsiders.
High-profile names from other successful companies.
But in the end, they made a surprising choice.
They chose an insider.
A quiet.
Thoughtful engineer who had spent twenty-two years at the company.
A man who was the opposite of his predecessor in almost every way.
His name was Satya Nadella.
To many, it seemed like an uninspired choice.
An admission of defeat.
How could a company man.
A product of the very culture that had failed.
Possibly be the one to save it.
What they didn't understand was that Nadella had seen the decay from the inside.
He had felt the frustration.
He had witnessed the missed opportunities.
And he had a radical idea.
An idea that went far beyond new products or new strategies.
He believed Microsoft didn't need a new direction.
It needed a new soul.
It needed to hit refresh.
This is the story of how one man’s vision for empathy and transformation resurrected a fallen giant.
It is a story of corporate culture.
Of leadership.
And of the profound power of rediscovering your purpose.
It is the story of Hit Refresh.

LESSON 1: REDISCOVER THE SOUL.
Every great company has a reason for being.
A core identity.
A soul.
For decades.
Microsoft’s soul was clear.
A computer on every desk and in every home.
Running Microsoft software.
This mission, set by Bill Gates, was audacious.
It was world-changing.
And for a long time, it drove everything the company did.
It fueled their ambition.
It justified their ruthless tactics.
It made them the most valuable company on Earth.
But by the 2010s, that mission was largely accomplished.
The world had computers.
The war was won.
And the company had no new purpose.
It was a conqueror without a kingdom to conquer.
Its new mission had become defensive.
Protect Windows at all costs.
Protect Office at all costs.
Every new idea.
Every new technology.
Was viewed through a single lens.
Does it help Windows.
If the answer was no, the idea was often killed.
A revolutionary tablet called the Courier was developed internally years before the iPad.
It was a dual-screen digital journal.
It was beautiful.
It was innovative.
But it didn't run a standard version of Windows.
So it was cancelled.
Microsoft was so busy protecting its past that it was sacrificing its future.
Satya Nadella saw this sickness clearly.
He knew that before he could fix the strategy or the products.
He had to fix the purpose.
He had to find the company’s soul again.
He embarked on a journey of discovery.
He talked to employees at every level.
He asked them a simple question.
Why does Microsoft exist.
Why should the world care if we disappear tomorrow.
He looked back at the company's origins.
He saw that the very first product Microsoft ever created was a BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800.
It wasn't an operating system.
It was a tool.
A tool that empowered hobbyists and developers to create something new.
It gave them power they didn't have before.
And in that origin story, Nadella found the spark.
He found the timeless truth of Microsoft.
The company was not about Windows.
It was not about Office.
It was about empowerment.
It was about creating technology so that others could create more technology.
From this realization, a new mission statement was born.
To empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
This was not just a clever marketing slogan.
It was a fundamental re-framing of the company’s entire existence.
It was a north star.
It was a declaration of independence from the tyranny of Windows.
Suddenly, the question was no longer "Does it help Windows.".
The question became "Does it empower our customers.".
If the answer was yes, then it was worth pursuing.
This meant making Office available on the iPad and iPhone.
An idea that was once considered blasphemy.
It meant embracing Linux on their cloud platform, Azure.
An act that would have been unthinkable just years earlier.
It meant shifting the focus from selling software licenses to providing cloud services that helped businesses grow.
This new soul was inclusive.
It was expansive.
It wasn't about Microsoft winning and everyone else losing.
It was about creating tools that allowed everyone to win.
Nadella knew this shift wouldn't be easy.
He had to repeat the mission statement over and over.
In every meeting.
In every email.
In every town hall.
He had to make it real.
He had to show the company that he meant it.
The soul of a company is its ultimate source of energy.
When it is lost.
The company drifts.
It becomes reactive.
It focuses on its competitors instead of its customers.
By finding and articulating a new, more profound purpose.
Nadella gave Microsoft its energy back.
He gave its employees a reason to be proud again.
He gave them a reason to innovate.
A reason to care.
He didn't just give them a new strategy.
He gave them a new identity.

LESSON 2: THE CULTURE SHOCK.
A company’s strategy is nothing without the right culture to execute it.
You can have the most brilliant plan in the world.
But if your people are working against each other.
If your culture is built on fear and internal competition.
That plan will fail.
This was the harsh reality at Microsoft when Nadella took over.
The internal culture had become a swamp of bureaucracy and infighting.
The company was a collection of feudal fiefdoms.
The Windows division.
The Office division.
The Server division.
Each operated like its own company.
Each with its own agenda.
Its own profit and loss statement.
They were often competing more fiercely with each other than with Apple or Google.
At the heart of this toxicity was the stack ranking system.
A performance review process that forced managers to grade their employees on a curve.
For every team, a certain percentage had to be rated as top performers.
A certain percentage as average.
And a certain percentage as poor performers who should be fired.
Imagine the consequences.
It meant that even on a team of superstars.
Someone had to be labeled a failure.
It destroyed teamwork.
Why would you help your colleague if their success could mean your failure.
It encouraged politics and backstabbing.
It discouraged risk-taking.
If you tried something new and it failed, you could find yourself at the bottom of the curve.
It was a culture of know-it-alls.
Everyone felt they had to have the right answer.
To show no weakness.
To be the smartest person in the room.
Meetings were confrontational.
They were arenas where people went to prove how smart they were by tearing down the ideas of others.
This was the culture Satya Nadella inherited.
And he knew it had to be destroyed.
He knew that his new mission of empowerment could never flourish in a garden of fear.
So his first major act as CEO wasn't a product announcement or a corporate restructuring.
It was a memo.
A memo that abolished the stack ranking system.
It was a symbolic earthquake.
It sent a message throughout the company.
The old ways are over.
The war is not inside these walls.
It is out there.
In its place, Nadella championed a new cultural framework.
A framework built on a single, powerful idea.
Empathy.
For Nadella, empathy was not a soft, feel-good concept.
It was the most important business tool in the 21st century.
Empathy is the ability to see the world from another’s perspective.
To understand their needs.
Their frustrations.
Their desires.
It is the core of customer-centricity.
You cannot build products people love if you do not understand them.
But Nadella took it a step further.
He argued for empathy inside the company as well.
Empathy for your colleagues.
Understanding their perspectives.
Working together to solve problems instead of trying to win arguments.
He wanted to transform Microsoft from a company of know-it-alls into a company of learn-it-alls.
This brings us to the second pillar of his cultural revolution.
The growth mindset.
A concept developed by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck.
The growth mindset is the belief that your abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work.
It is the opposite of a fixed mindset.
Which is the belief that your talents are innate gifts.
A person with a fixed mindset avoids challenges.
They see failure as a judgment on their inherent ability.
They are a know-it-all.
A person with a growth mindset embraces challenges.
They see failure as an opportunity to learn and grow.
They are a learn-it-all.
Nadella made the growth mindset the new gospel of Microsoft.
He talked about it constantly.
He encouraged managers to reward learning and effort, not just success.
He wanted to create a culture where it was safe to say "I don't know".
Where it was safe to make mistakes.
As long as you learned from them.
This was a radical transformation.
It required unlearning decades of ingrained behavior.
It was uncomfortable.
It was difficult.
There was resistance.
Some old-guard leaders couldn't adapt.
And they left.
But slowly, painstakingly.
The culture began to shift.
Collaboration started to replace confrontation.
Curiosity started to replace certainty.
Teams that once hoarded information began to share it openly.
The walls between the fiefdoms began to crumble.
The cultural change was the hardest part of Microsoft’s transformation.
It was also the most important.
Because it was the culture that had been holding the company back.
Nadella understood a fundamental truth of leadership.
The CEO is the curator of the organization's culture.
He knew that his primary job was not to be the chief product officer.
Or the chief strategist.
It was to be the chief culture officer.
By changing the way people at Microsoft thought about themselves and their colleagues.
He unlocked the human potential that had been dormant for a decade.
He turned a collection of warring tribes into a unified team.
Focused on a single mission.

LESSON 3: FROM "KNOW-IT-ALL" TO "LEARN-IT-ALL".
The journey from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset is not a theoretical exercise.
It is a daily practice.
It requires humility.
It requires curiosity.
And it requires courage.
For a company like Microsoft.
A company that had dominated an entire industry for two decades.
Humility was a foreign concept.
The company was built on being right.
On being the smartest.
On knowing best.
This "know-it-all" attitude was its greatest strength in the PC era.
It was its greatest weakness in the mobile and cloud era.
When the iPhone was released.
Microsoft’s leadership famously scoffed at it.
They couldn't see its potential because it didn't fit their worldview.
It didn't have a physical keyboard.
It wasn't good for creating Office documents.
It wasn't a serious business device.
They knew better.
Or so they thought.
They were trapped in their own success.
They were blinded by their own certainties.
Nadella knew that to survive.
Microsoft had to learn to be a student again.
It had to become a learn-it-all organization.
This meant actively seeking out new ideas.
Even ideas that seemed threatening to the existing business.
It meant listening.
Really listening.
To customers.
To partners.
And even to competitors.
One of Nadella's most powerful symbolic acts was during his first public presentation to developers.
He pulled out an iPhone from his pocket.
On stage.
As the CEO of Microsoft.
He proceeded to demonstrate how Microsoft's best cloud and software services.
Like Outlook and Office.
Worked beautifully on Apple's device.
The audience was stunned.
For years, the iPhone was seen as the enemy.
A symbol of Microsoft’s failure in mobile.
Here was the new CEO, not just acknowledging it.
But embracing it.
He was showing the world.
And more importantly, his own employees.
That the world had changed.
Microsoft would no longer be a company that dictated terms to its customers.
It would be a company that met customers where they were.
On the devices they loved.
On the platforms they used.
This was the learn-it-all mindset in action.
It was about admitting that Microsoft didn't have all the answers.
It was about acknowledging that the customer knew best.
Nadella also fostered this mindset internally.
He encouraged a practice he called "one Microsoft".
The idea was to break down the silos and get people talking to each other.
To learn from each other's successes and failures.
He started holding a monthly employee town hall.
Where anyone could ask him anything.
No question was off-limits.
He was often asked tough, critical questions.
And he answered them with honesty and humility.
He modeled the behavior he wanted to see.
He showed that it was okay to be vulnerable.
It was okay to not have all the answers.
The goal was not to be right.
The goal was to learn.
Another key part of being a learn-it-all is confronting your own biases.
Nadella had a powerful personal experience with this.
Early in his tenure, at a conference for women in computing.
He was asked for his advice for women who are not comfortable asking for a raise.
He gave a clumsy, poorly-phrased answer.
Suggesting that women should trust in the system and have faith in their karma.
The backlash was immediate and fierce.
He had made a major mistake.
The old Microsoft playbook would have been to issue a carefully worded corporate apology and move on.
To manage the PR crisis.
Nadella did something different.
He sent a heartfelt, personal email to all employees that same evening.
He didn't make excuses.
He said simply, "I was wrong.".
He admitted his own unconscious bias.
He talked about how much he had to learn.
He turned a moment of public failure into a powerful teaching moment for the entire company.
He showed them what being a learn-it-all looked like in practice.
It wasn't just about learning new technologies.
It was about learning about yourself.
About your blind spots.
About how to be a better human being.
This shift from know-it-all to learn-it-all was not about being weak.
It was about being intellectually honest.
It's a recognition that in a rapidly changing world.
The most valuable skill is not what you know.
It's how fast you can learn.
By instilling this value deep into the company’s DNA.
Nadella made Microsoft agile again.
He gave it the ability to adapt.
To evolve.
And to once again, lead the way into the future.

LESSON 4: EMBRACE YOUR RIVALS.
For most of its history.
Microsoft's relationship with its competitors was simple.
It was war.
The company was famous for its "embrace, extend, and extinguish" strategy.
It would enter a new market.
Embrace the existing standards.
Extend them with proprietary Microsoft features.
And ultimately extinguish the competition.
Linux was once called a "cancer" by former CEO Steve Ballmer.
Apple was the arch-nemesis.
Open source was a threat to be contained.
The company saw the world in binary terms.
You were either with Microsoft, or you were against it.
This worldview was a relic of the PC era.
When Microsoft controlled the dominant platform.
Windows.
In that world, it could set the rules.
But in the new world of the cloud and mobile.
Microsoft was no longer the king of the hill.
It was just one player in a complex, interconnected ecosystem.
The old, confrontational approach was not just ineffective.
It was suicidal.
Nadella understood this better than anyone.
He saw that the future was not about closed systems and walled gardens.
It was about open platforms and partnerships.
He knew that to be relevant.
Microsoft had to learn to play well with others.
Even its oldest and bitterest rivals.
This led to some of the most shocking and transformative decisions in the company's history.
The first salvo was Office for the iPad.
For years, Microsoft had resisted putting its flagship productivity suite on Apple's tablet.
The thinking was that keeping Office exclusive to Windows would help sell more Surface tablets.
It was a classic example of protecting the old business model at the expense of customer needs.
Millions of people wanted to use Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on their iPads.
And Microsoft was telling them no.
Nadella reversed this decision almost immediately.
He launched Office for iPad at a major press event.
It was a statement of intent.
Microsoft would no longer hold its customers hostage.
It would serve them wherever they were.
The move was a massive success.
It generated billions in new revenue.
And it rebuilt goodwill with a generation of customers who had written Microsoft off.
But this was just the beginning.
The next step was even more radical.
Nadella announced that Microsoft Loves Linux.
The statement was so shocking it was almost comical.
This was the same company that had waged a holy war against the open-source operating system for over a decade.
But Nadella saw reality.
Linux was the dominant operating system in the cloud.
Tens of thousands of developers and businesses relied on it.
If Microsoft’s cloud platform, Azure, was going to compete with Amazon Web Services.
It had to be the best place to run Linux workloads.
To fight Linux was to fight the future.
So Microsoft embraced it.
They made it a first-class citizen on Azure.
They contributed to the Linux kernel.
They even released their own version of Linux for specific applications.
They went from being the biggest enemy of open source to one of its biggest contributors.
The old guard inside Microsoft was horrified.
The company's identity was built on the Windows vs. Linux war.
To them, this felt like a surrender.
But Nadella framed it differently.
This was not about surrender.
It was about growth.
The world was bigger than Windows.
The opportunity was in being the platform that could run everything.
Windows.
Linux.
Anything the customer wanted.
This new philosophy of partnership extended everywhere.
Microsoft partnered with Sony and Nintendo in gaming.
It partnered with Salesforce, a major competitor in business software.
It acquired GitHub, the largest platform for open-source developers in the world.
Each of these moves would have been unthinkable under the old regime.
Each one was a deliberate decision to replace conflict with cooperation.
To choose partnership over proprietorship.
Nadella understood that in a networked age.
Your success is increasingly dependent on the success of others.
A company that insists on doing everything itself.
A company that sees everyone else as an enemy.
Will ultimately find itself isolated.
And irrelevant.
By teaching the old giant how to make friends.
Nadella opened up a universe of new possibilities.
He transformed Microsoft from a closed fortress into an open platform.
He showed that true strength lies not in your ability to defeat your rivals.
But in your ability to work with them to create a bigger pie for everyone.

LESSON 5: BET ON THE FUTURE.
Every great CEO must be a visionary.
They must be able to see the future before it arrives.
And they must have the courage to bet the company's resources on that vision.
When Satya Nadella became CEO.
Microsoft had many different businesses.
Windows.
Office.
Xbox.
Servers.
Bing.
But it was clear that the company's center of gravity was still the past.
The PC.
Nadella knew that the future lay elsewhere.
It was in the cloud.
The cloud was not a new concept in 2014.
Amazon Web Services had been around for years and was already a dominant force.
Microsoft had its own cloud platform, Azure.
But it was a distant second.
Internally, many people at Microsoft still saw the cloud as a threat.
A threat to their lucrative on-premise server and software business.
Every dollar a customer spent on the cloud was a dollar they didn't spend on a Windows Server license.
Nadella had a completely different perspective.
He had run the cloud and enterprise group before becoming CEO.
He had seen its potential firsthand.
He believed the cloud wasn't just a new business model.
It was the next fundamental shift in computing.
As big as the shift from the mainframe to the PC.
He saw a future where nearly all of the world's computing power would live in massive, global data centers.
Where businesses and individuals would access that power as a utility.
Like electricity.
In this future, the operating system of your phone or laptop would become less important.
The real platform would be the cloud.
He saw this not as a threat to Microsoft.
But as its single greatest opportunity.
Here was a chance to build the next generation's operating system.
An operating system for the entire world's data.
So he made a bold decision.
He declared that Microsoft would be a "cloud-first, mobile-first" company.
The order of those words was critical.
Cloud-first.
This was the new priority.
This was the new center of the Microsoft universe.
He backed this vision with a massive commitment of resources.
He poured billions of dollars into building new data centers all over the world.
He hired thousands of the world's best engineers.
He re-organized the entire company to support the cloud strategy.
The engineering teams for Windows and Azure were brought closer together.
The sales force was retrained to sell cloud services instead of software boxes.
The entire rhythm of the company shifted.
From the three-year release cycle of Windows to the continuous, daily updates of the cloud.
It was a monumental bet.
And it was incredibly risky.
Microsoft was essentially competing with its own successful past.
It was asking its biggest customers to stop buying its most profitable products.
And to move to a new, subscription-based model.
For a time, revenues were uncertain.
The transition was painful.
The stock market was skeptical.
But Nadella held firm.
He knew that you cannot cling to the past and embrace the future at the same time.
You have to choose.
He chose the future.
Slowly, the bet began to pay off.
Azure started to grow at an astonishing rate.
It began to close the gap with Amazon.
It won huge contracts with some of the world's largest companies.
Walmart.
AT&T.
Volkswagen.
These companies chose Microsoft not just for its technology.
But because they saw it as a true partner.
Unlike Amazon, which competed with them in many of their core businesses.
The "embrace your rivals" philosophy was paying dividends.
The cloud became the engine of Microsoft's rebirth.
It powered everything else.
Office 365, the cloud-based version of the productivity suite, became a massive success.
Xbox evolved from a simple gaming console into a cloud gaming service.
Even Windows itself began to integrate more deeply with the cloud.
Nadella’s bet on the future had saved the company.
It had given it a new, powerful growth engine.
It had made it relevant again in the most important technological trend of our time.
The lesson is profound.
Leaders must be willing to disrupt their own businesses.
They must have the foresight to see where the world is going.
And the courage to skate to where the puck is going to be.
Not where it has been.
Satya Nadella saw the future in the cloud.
And by betting everything on it.
He ensured that Microsoft would have a future.

LESSON 6: LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT CREATING CLARITY.
In times of great change and uncertainty.
The most important role of a leader is to create clarity.
When a company is lost.
When its people are confused and demoralized.
When the path forward is shrouded in fog.
The leader must be the lighthouse.
They must provide a clear and compelling vision of the destination.
And they must generate the energy needed to get there.
This was perhaps Satya Nadella’s greatest gift to Microsoft.
He took a complex, sprawling, and dysfunctional organization.
And he gave it clarity.
Clarity of purpose.
With the new mission to empower everyone on the planet.
Clarity of culture.
With the shift to empathy and a growth mindset.
Clarity of strategy.
With the "cloud-first, mobile-first" mantra.
Nadella has a simple framework for leadership.
He believes a leader's job is to create clarity.
Generate energy.
And deliver success.
In that order.
Clarity comes first.
You cannot energize people if they don't know what they are supposed to be doing or why it matters.
Nadella created this clarity through constant, consistent communication.
He was relentless in repeating his core messages.
The mission statement.
The growth mindset.
The importance of the cloud.
He used every opportunity.
From big public speeches to small team meetings.
To reinforce the new direction.
He made sure that everyone in the company.
From the senior executives to the new interns.
Understood the plan.
Once clarity is established.
The next job is to generate energy.
Energy is the lifeblood of an organization.
It is the passion.
The enthusiasm.
The drive to innovate and execute.
Nadella generated energy not through loud speeches or charismatic stagecraft.
He did it through empowerment.
He trusted his teams.
He gave them the autonomy to take risks and make decisions.
He celebrated learning and progress, not just perfect results.
He created a culture where people felt safe to bring their best ideas forward.
He energized the company by connecting their daily work to a higher purpose.
You aren't just writing code for a server product.
You are building the cloud infrastructure that will power the next medical breakthrough.
Or help a small business in Africa reach a global market.
This sense of purpose is the most powerful fuel for human energy.
Finally, a leader must deliver success.
Clarity and energy are meaningless if they don't lead to results.
Success creates a virtuous cycle.
It validates the vision.
It proves that the new culture is working.
It gives people confidence and builds momentum.
Nadella delivered success by making tough choices.
He made the painful decision to write off the failed Nokia acquisition.
A move that cost the company billions of dollars but allowed it to finally move on from its mobile phone disaster.
He made the bet on the cloud and delivered spectacular growth.
He oversaw the successful launch of new products like the Surface line and the HoloLens.
He guided the company to new heights of financial performance.
Making it once again one of the most valuable companies in the world.
This framework.
Clarity, Energy, Success.
Is a powerful model for leadership at any level.
It is a reminder that leadership is not about having all the answers.
It is about creating an environment where others can find them.
It is not about command and control.
It is about trust and empowerment.
Satya Nadella’s leadership was a quiet revolution.
He did not remake Microsoft in his own image.
He helped Microsoft rediscover the best version of itself.
He hit refresh.
The story of Microsoft's transformation is more than just a business case study.
It is a human story.
It's a story about how a company, like a person, can get lost.
It can forget who it is.
It can become trapped by its past successes.
But it is also a story of redemption.
It shows that it is never too late to change.
It is never too late to rediscover your purpose.
To rebuild your culture.
And to embrace the future with a renewed sense of optimism and humility.
The world is constantly changing.
Technology is constantly evolving.
The challenges we face are becoming more complex.
In such a world, the ability to "hit refresh".
To let go of old dogmas and embrace new ideas.
To lead with empathy.
Is the most critical skill of all.
For individuals.
For organizations.
And for society as a whole.
The giant from Redmond is awake again.
And it is looking at the world not as a kingdom to be conquered.
But as a planet to be empowered.
