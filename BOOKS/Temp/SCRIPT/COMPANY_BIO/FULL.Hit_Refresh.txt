INTRO

THIS IS NOT A STORY OF SUCCESS. IT IS A STORY OF SURVIVAL AGAINST ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE ODDS. IT IS A STORY ABOUT AN EMPIRE, A COLOSSAL, UNYIELDING JUGGERNAUT OF TECHNOLOGY, THAT FOUND ITSELF STARING DIRECTLY INTO THE ABYSS OF ITS OWN EXTINCTION. THE BOOK IS TITLED 'HIT REFRESH'. THE AUTHOR IS SATYA NADELLA. BUT THIS IS NOT A MERE AUTOBIOGRAPHY. IT IS A DESPERATE WARNING. IT IS A BRUTALLY HONEST CONFESSION OF CATASTROPHIC FAILURE. IT IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR A RESURRECTION SO VIOLENT AND SO RADICAL THAT IT BORDERED ON CORPORATE SUICIDE. THIS IS THE STORY OF A MAN WHO INHERITED A THRONE OF ASHES AND WAS GIVEN A SINGLE, TERRIFYING MANDATE: SAVE MICROSOFT FROM ITSELF, OR PRESIDE OVER THE GREATEST COLLAPSE IN MODERN HISTORY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK WAS NOT TO CELEBRATE A TURNAROUND. IT WAS TO DOCUMENT, WITH UNFLINCHING DETAIL, THE AGONIZING PROCESS OF DRAGGING A MONOLITHIC BEAST, KICKING AND SCREAMING, OUT OF ITS OWN GRAVE. IT IS A TESTAMENT TO THE FACT THAT INSIDE EVERY SEEMINGLY INVINCIBLE FORTRESS, THE SEEDS OF COMPLETE AND UTTER DESTRUCTION ARE ALWAYS SOWING THEMSELVES.

THE KINGDOM OF THE DAMNED

BEFORE THE RECKONING, THERE WAS THE EMPIRE. AN EMPIRE BUILT ON A SINGLE, UNASSAILABLE TRUTH: WINDOWS. MICROSOFT WAS NOT A COMPANY; IT WAS A GLOBAL OPERATING SYSTEM FOR HUMANITY. ITS POWER WAS ABSOLUTE. ITS WEALTH WAS INCALCULABLE. ITS ARROGANCE WAS LIMITLESS. AT ITS HELM STOOD A MAN NAMED STEVE BALLMER, A LEADER OF PURE, UNADULTERATED INTENSITY. HIS REIGN WAS ONE OF EXPLOSIVE ENERGY AND VICIOUS, BONE-CRUSHING DEFENSE OF THE OLD WAYS. THE COMPANY WAS A FORTRESS, AND BALLMER WAS THE WARLORD STANDING ON THE RAMPARTS, SCREAMING DEFIANCE AT A WORLD THAT WAS ALREADY LEAVING HIM BEHIND.

BUT INSIDE THE WALLS OF THIS FORTRESS, A DEEP, VIRULENT POISON WAS SPREADING. A SICKNESS OF THE SOUL HAD TAKEN ROOT. IT WAS CALLED STACK RANKING. THIS WAS NOT A PERFORMANCE REVIEW SYSTEM. IT WAS A MANDATORY, ANNUAL BLOODLETTING. EVERY SINGLE TEAM, IN EVERY SINGLE DIVISION, WAS FORCED BY AN IRON-CLAD EDICT TO DESIGNATE A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE AS TOP PERFORMERS, AVERAGE PERFORMERS, AND FAILURES. THIS SYSTEM DID NOT REWARD COLLABORATION. IT ANNIHILATED IT. IT TURNED EVERY COLLEAGUE INTO A POTENTIAL ENEMY. IT TRANSFORMED EVERY MEETING INTO A BATTLEGROUND. YOUR SURVIVAL DEPENDED NOT ON THE TEAM'S SUCCESS, BUT ON YOUR ABILITY TO POLITICALLY OUTMANEUVER AND CRUSH THE PERSON SITTING NEXT TO YOU.

GENIUS ENGINEERS, THE VERY PEOPLE WHO HAD BUILT THE EMPIRE, WERE REDUCED TO BACKSTABBING POLITICIANS. THEY HOARDED INFORMATION. THEY SABOTAGED EACH OTHER'S PROJECTS. THEY FOUGHT VICIOUSLY FOR RESOURCES, NOT TO BUILD SOMETHING GREAT, BUT TO ENSURE THEIR OWN SURVIVAL IN THE NEXT CULLING. THE BRIGHTEST MINDS ON THE PLANET WERE TRAPPED IN A GLADIATORIAL ARENA OF MICROSOFT'S OWN MAKING, FORCED TO FIGHT TO THE DEATH WHILE THE REAL ENEMIES—APPLE, GOOGLE, AMAZON—WERE OUTSIDE THE WALLS, BUILDING THE FUTURE AND STEALING MICROSOFT'S CROWN. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS NOT MERELY TOXIC; IT WAS RADIOACTIVE. IT WAS A CULTURE OF FEAR, PARANOIA, AND SYSTEMATICALLY ENFORCED DISTRUST. THIS WAS THE MICROSOFT THAT SATYA NADELLA KNEW. HE LIVED IT. HE BREATHED IT. HE SAW THE ROT FROM THE INSIDE, SPREADING THROUGH EVERY LEVEL OF THE COMPANY LIKE A TERMINAL CANCER.

THE PROCESSION OF CATASTROPHES

THE WORLD OUTSIDE THE FORTRESS WAS CHANGING AT A TERRIFYING SPEED, AND MICROSOFT WAS UTTERLY, CATASTROPHICALLY BLIND. THE COMPANY WAS SO OBSESSED WITH PROTECTING ITS PAST THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY IGNORING THE FUTURE. THE FIRST SHOT WAS FIRED BY APPLE. IT WAS CALLED THE IPOD. MICROSOFT’S RESPONSE WAS THE ZUNE. IT WAS A TECHNICALLY COMPETENT DEVICE THAT WAS LAUNCHED INTO A MARKET ALREADY CONQUERED. IT WAS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FAILURE. A MONUMENT TO ARROGANCE AND DELUSION. IT WAS A PUBLIC HUMILIATION THAT COST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

THEN CAME THE EARTHQUAKE. THE IPHONE. STEVE JOBS STOOD ON A STAGE AND UNVEILED A DEVICE THAT WOULD NOT JUST CHANGE THE PHONE INDUSTRY; IT WOULD CHANGE HUMANITY ITSELF. MICROSOFT’S REACTION WAS LAUGHTER. STEVE BALLMER HIMSELF PUBLICLY SCOFFED AT THE IPHONE. HE DECLARED IT AN EXPENSIVE TOY THAT NO BUSINESS PERSON WOULD EVER USE BECAUSE IT LACKED A PHYSICAL KEYBOARD. IT WAS ONE OF THE SINGLE MOST DESTRUCTIVELY WRONG PREDICTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF TECHNOLOGY. WHILE APPLE WAS BUILDING AN ECOSYSTEM OF APPS AND SERVICES THAT WOULD ENSNARE BILLIONS OF USERS, MICROSOFT WAS CLINGING TO ITS DYING WINDOWS MOBILE PLATFORM. IT WAS A CLUNKY, OUTDATED, AND UTTERLY UNINSPIRING PIECE OF SOFTWARE THAT STOOD NO CHANCE. THE COMPANY HAD MISSED THE SINGLE GREATEST TECHNOLOGICAL SHIFT OF THE 21ST CENTURY. IT WASN'T A MISTAKE; IT WAS AN ACT OF CORPORATE MALPRACTICE ON AN UNIMAGINABLE SCALE.

THE NEXT BATTLEGROUND WAS THE INTERNET ITSELF. GOOGLE HAD DOMINATED SEARCH. ITS POWER WAS ABSOLUTE. MICROSOFT’S ATTEMPT TO COMPETE, BING, WAS A COSTLY AND DESPERATE GAMBLE. IT WAS A WAR OF ATTRITION THAT BURNED THROUGH BILLIONS UPON BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, YEAR AFTER YEAR, WITH ALMOST NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT. MICROSOFT WAS BLEEDING MONEY IN A FIGHT IT COULD NEVER, EVER WIN. THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGHT YESTERDAY’S WAR WHILE A NEW, EVEN MORE IMPORTANT CONFLICT WAS EMERGING: THE CLOUD.

A COMPANY CALLED AMAZON, A BOOKSELLER, HAD QUIETLY BUILT SOMETHING CALLED AMAZON WEB SERVICES. IT WAS A REVOLUTION. IT ALLOWED ANYONE, FROM A SINGLE DEVELOPER TO A MASSIVE CORPORATION, TO RENT LIMITLESS COMPUTING POWER. IT WAS THE FUTURE OF ALL TECHNOLOGY. AND MICROSOFT, THE GREATEST SOFTWARE COMPANY ON EARTH, WAS ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL. THEY WERE SO OBSESSED WITH SELLING BOXED COPIES OF WINDOWS AND OFFICE THAT THEY COULD NOT COMPREHEND A WORLD WHERE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES WERE RENTED OVER THE INTERNET. THEY SAW THE CLOUD NOT AS AN OPPORTUNITY, BUT AS A MORTAL THREAT TO THEIR EXISTING BUSINESS. AND SO THEY HESITATED. THAT HESITATION WAS NEARLY FATAL.

THE FINAL, DESPERATE GAMBLE OF THE OLD REGIME WAS THE ACQUISITION OF NOKIA'S HANDSET BUSINESS. IT WAS A SEVEN-BILLION-DOLLAR BET MADE OUT OF PURE TERROR. FACING THE UNDENIABLE REALITY THAT WINDOWS PHONE WAS A COMPLETE FAILURE, MICROSOFT BELIEVED THAT BY BUYING THE WORLD'S LARGEST PHONE MANUFACTURER, IT COULD FORCE ITS SOFTWARE ONTO THE WORLD. IT WAS A DISASTER OF EPIC PROPORTIONS. THEY WERE BUYING A SINKING SHIP IN THE MIDDLE OF A HURRICANE. THE DEAL WAS A MONUMENTAL CATASTROPHE. IT WAS SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TURNED TO ASH. IT WAS THE TOMBSTONE OF MICROSOFT'S MOBILE AMBITIONS. THE COMPANY WASN'T JUST LOSING. IT WAS BEING SYSTEMATICALLY DISMANTLED BY ITS OWN INCOMPETENCE. THE FORTRESS WAS CRUMBLING. THE EMPIRE WAS FALLING. A SUCCESSION CRISIS WAS IMMINENT.

THE IMPOSSIBLE CANDIDATE

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS KNEW THE COMPANY WAS DYING. STEVE BALLMER, AFTER FOURTEEN YEARS OF FEROCIOUS, PROFITABLE, YET ULTIMATELY DESTRUCTIVE LEADERSHIP, WAS STEPPING DOWN. THE SEARCH FOR A NEW CEO BEGAN. IT WAS A GLOBAL HUNT FOR A SAVIOR. THEY LOOKED AT OUTSIDERS. TITANS OF INDUSTRY. VISIONARIES FROM OTHER COMPANIES WHO COULD COME IN AND SHATTER THE OLD WAYS. THE IDEA OF PROMOTING AN INSIDER, A MICROSOFT LIFER, WAS ALMOST UNTHINKABLE. ANYONE WHO HAD SPENT DECADES INSIDE THE POISONED CULTURE WAS PRESUMED TO BE PART OF THE PROBLEM.

YET, THERE WAS ONE MAN. SATYA NADELLA. AN ENGINEER WHO HAD QUIETLY, METHODICALLY WORKED HIS WAY UP THE RANKS FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. HE WAS NOT A SHOWMAN. HE WAS NOT A WARLORD. HE WAS A QUIET, THOUGHTFUL, HUMBLE MAN. ON THE SURFACE, HE WAS THE ABSOLUTE ANTITHESIS OF EVERYTHING MICROSOFT HAD BECOME. HE WAS RUNNING THE COMPANY'S CLOUD AND ENTERPRISE DIVISION. IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW PARTS OF THE BUSINESS THAT WAS ACTUALLY GROWING, A SMALL POCKET OF SUCCESS IN A VAST OCEAN OF FAILURE. HE HAD SEEN THE FUTURE IN THE CLOUD WHILE THE REST OF THE COMPANY WAS STILL OBSESSED WITH THE PAST.

HIS SELECTION WAS NOT A MOMENT OF TRIUMPH. IT WAS A MOMENT OF EXTREME RISK. THE BOARD WASN'T JUST HIRING A CEO. THEY WERE PLACING A TRILLION-DOLLAR BET ON THE HOPE THAT A MAN SO DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE FAILED SYSTEM COULD SOMEHOW FIND THE STRENGTH TO BRUTALLY DESTROY IT. HE WASN'T AN OUTSIDER WITH A CLEAN SLATE. HE WAS AN INSIDER WHO HAD SURVIVED THE PURGES, NAVIGATED THE TOXIC POLITICS, AND WATCHED THE CATASTROPHES UNFOLD FIRSTHAND. THE QUESTION WASN'T WHETHER HE UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEMS. THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER, AFTER TWO DECADES, HE HAD BECOME IRREVERSIBLY TAINTED BY THEM. COULD A PRISONER, ONCE GIVEN THE KEYS, TRULY REFORM THE ENTIRE PRISON SYSTEM? OR WOULD HE SIMPLY BECOME ANOTHER WARDEN?

HIS VERY FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE AS CEO WAS A NEAR-FATAL DISASTER. AT A CONFERENCE CELEBRATING WOMEN IN COMPUTING, HE WAS ASKED WHAT ADVICE HE HAD FOR WOMEN WHO WERE UNCOMFORTABLE ASKING FOR A RAISE. HIS ANSWER WAS A STUNNING, UNFORGIVABLE MISSTEP. HE SUGGESTED THAT WOMEN SHOULDN'T ASK FOR RAISES BUT INSTEAD TRUST IN THE SYSTEM AND GOOD KARMA. THE BACKLASH WAS INSTANTANEOUS, GLOBAL, AND ABSOLUTELY MERCILESS. THE NEW SAVIOR, THE EMPATHETIC LEADER CHOSEN TO HEAL THE COMPANY'S SOUL, HAD JUST REVEALED HIMSELF TO BE HORRIFICALLY OUT OF TOUCH. IT WAS A PUBLIC RELATIONS NIGHTMARE OF THE HIGHEST ORDER. HIS REIGN WAS ALMOST OVER BEFORE IT HAD EVEN BEGUN. IN THAT MOMENT OF INTENSE, SCALDING HUMILIATION, NADELA FACED HIS FIRST TRUE TEST. HE COULD DOUBLE DOWN, DEFEND HIMSELF, AND BLAME THE MEDIA. OR HE COULD DO SOMETHING UTTERLY ALIEN TO THE OLD MICROSOFT. HE COULD ADMIT HE WAS CATASTROPHICALLY WRONG. HE IMMEDIATELY SENT A COMPANY-WIDE MEMO, NOT MAKING EXCUSES, BUT OFFERING A PROFOUND, UNEQUIVOCAL APOLOGY. HE STATED SIMPLY: "I WAS WRONG." FOR A COMPANY BUILT ON A "KNOW-IT-ALL" CULTURE, THESE THREE WORDS WERE A REVOLUTION. IT WAS THE FIRST SHOCKWAVE OF THE COMING EARTHQUAKE.

THE PURGE

NADELLA KNEW THAT SUBTLE CHANGES WOULD BE USELESS. THE SICKNESS WAS TOO DEEP. THE ROT WAS TOO PERVASIVE. HE NEEDED TO PERFORM RADICAL SURGERY, EVEN IF IT KILLED THE PATIENT. HIS FIRST TARGET WAS THE VERY HEART OF THE POISON: STACK RANKING. WITH A SINGLE, BRUTAL EDICT, HE ABOLISHED IT. HE KILLED IT. HE ANNOUNCED THAT THE ANNUAL GLADIATORIAL COMBAT WAS OVER. THE SHOCK INSIDE THE COMPANY WAS ABSOLUTE. IT WAS AS IF A DICTATOR HAD SUDDENLY DECLARED THE END OF HIS OWN SECRET POLICE. FOR YEARS, THE ENTIRE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF MICROSOFT HAD BEEN BUILT AROUND THIS BRUTAL SYSTEM. MANAGERS DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO FUNCTION WITHOUT IT. EMPLOYEES COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS REAL.

THIS WAS NOT A POPULAR DECISION AMONG THE OLD GUARD. THE WARLORDS WHO HAD THRIVED IN THE SYSTEM OF FEAR AND INTIMIDATION SAW THEIR POWER EVAPORATE OVERNIGHT. BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF EMPLOYEES, IT WAS A MOMENT OF LIBERATION SO PROFOUND IT FELT UNREAL. IT WAS THE FIRST SIGN THAT THE NEW KING WAS NOT LIKE THE OLD KINGS. HE WAS NOT THERE TO PERPETUATE THE CYCLE OF PAIN. HE WAS THERE TO BREAK IT.

BUT DESTROYING A SYSTEM WAS NOT ENOUGH. HE HAD TO REPLACE THE UNDERLYING IDEOLOGY. HE HAD TO PERFORM A CULTURAL BRAIN TRANSPLANT ON OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. HE INTRODUCED A NEW, RADICAL CONCEPT TO THE MICROSOFT LEXICON. A SINGLE WORD THAT WOULD BECOME HIS ULTIMATE WEAPON: EMPATHY. HE DECLARED THAT MICROSOFT'S ABILITY TO SURVIVE DEPENDED ENTIRELY ON ITS ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS AND PAIN OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THIS WAS A DIRECT ASSAULT ON THE COMPANY'S CORE IDENTITY. MICROSOFT HAD ALWAYS BEEN A COMPANY OF "KNOW-IT-ALLS." THEY BELIEVED THEY WERE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN THE ROOM AND THAT THEIR JOB WAS TO TELL THE WORLD WHAT IT NEEDED. NADELLA DEMANDED A COMPLETE AND TOTAL INVERSION OF THIS BELIEF. HE CHAMPIONED A "LEARN-IT-ALL" CULTURE. HE FORCED HIS ENGINEERS, HIS MARKETERS, HIS SALESPEOPLE TO STOP TALKING AND START LISTENING. HE DIDN'T CARE HOW BRILLIANT YOU WERE IF YOU COULD NOT CONNECT WITH AND UNDERSTAND ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

THIS WAS A WAR FOR THE SOUL OF THE COMPANY. HE BEGAN EVERY SENIOR LEADERSHIP MEETING NOT WITH FINANCIALS OR PRODUCT ROADMAPS, BUT WITH DISCUSSIONS OF CULTURE. HE WAS OBSESSED. HE KNEW THAT IF HE COULD NOT CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE THOUGHT AND FELT, NO AMOUNT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION WOULD SAVE THEM. HE HAD TO PURGE THE ARROGANCE. HE HAD TO ERADICATE THE HOSTILITY. HE HAD TO REPLACE A CULTURE OF INTERNAL COMBAT WITH ONE OF RELENTLESS CUSTOMER OBSESSION.

THEN CAME THE MOMENT OF ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. THE NOKIA DISASTER. THE SEVEN-BILLION-DOLLAR MONUMENT TO FAILURE WAS STILL ON THE BOOKS, A CONSTANT, HUMILIATING REMINDER OF THEIR DEFEAT IN THE MOBILE WARS. THOUSANDS OF FORMER NOKIA EMPLOYEES WERE NOW MICROSOFT EMPLOYEES, TRAPPED IN A STRATEGY THAT WAS DOOMED FROM THE START. NADELLA HAD TO MAKE A BRUTAL CHOICE. HE COULD LET THE SITUATION FESTER, SLOWLY BLEEDING MONEY AND MORALE. OR HE COULD AMPUTATE THE GANGRENOUS LIMB. HE CHOSE AMPUTATION. HE ANNOUNCED THAT MICROSOFT WAS WRITING OFF ALMOST THE ENTIRE VALUE OF THE NOKIA ACQUISITION. IT WAS A 7.6 BILLION DOLLAR ADMISSION OF CATASTROPHIC DEFEAT. IT WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST CORPORATE WRITE-DOWNS IN HISTORY. ALONG WITH IT CAME THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF LAYOFFS. IT WAS A BLOODBATH. IT WAS A PAINFUL, HORRIFYING, BUT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY ACT OF DESTRUCTION. HE WAS PUBLICLY EXECUTING THE FAILED STRATEGY OF THE PAST. HE WAS TELLING THE WORLD, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, HIS OWN COMPANY, THAT THE DREAM OF A WINDOWS-DOMINATED PHONE UNIVERSE WAS DEAD. IT WAS OVER. AND THEY HAD TO MOVE ON, OR DIE WITH IT.

A PACT WITH THE DEVIL

THE OLD MICROSOFT HAD A SIMPLE, UNYIELDING RELIGION: WINDOWS ABOVE ALL ELSE. EVERY PRODUCT, EVERY STRATEGY, EVERY DECISION WAS DESIGNED TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM. IT WAS THE SACRED, UNTOUCHABLE CORE OF THE EMPIRE. SATYA NADELLA COMMITTED THE ULTIMATE HERESY. HE DECLARED THAT THE RELIGION WAS FALSE. HE ANNOUNCED THAT MICROSOFT’S FUTURE WAS NOT ABOUT FORCING PEOPLE ONTO WINDOWS. IT WAS ABOUT MEETING CUSTOMERS WHEREVER THEY WERE. AND THEY WERE ON IOS. THEY WERE ON ANDROID.

THE FIRST SHOCK CAME WHEN NADELLA HIMSELF STOOD ON A STAGE AND DEMONSTRATED MICROSOFT OFFICE RUNNING FLAWLESSLY ON AN APPLE IPAD. TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD, IT SEEMED LIKE A LOGICAL BUSINESS MOVE. TO THE INSIDERS AT MICROSOFT, IT WAS A MOMENT OF PROFOUND, JAW-DROPPING BETRAYAL. FOR YEARS, THE IDEA OF PUTTING THEIR CROWN JEWEL, OFFICE, ON A RIVAL PLATFORM WAS CONSIDERED TREASON. IT WAS THE ONE LEVER THEY HAD TO KEEP PEOPLE LOCKED INTO THE WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM. NADELLA DIDN'T JUST PULL THE LEVER; HE RIPPED IT OUT AND THREW IT AWAY. HE WAS SIGNALING A COMPLETE AND TOTAL SURRENDER IN THE PLATFORM WARS. HE WAS ADMITTING THAT MICROSOFT HAD LOST, AND THAT THEIR ONLY PATH TO SURVIVAL WAS TO BECOME A SERVICE PROVIDER ON THE VERY PLATFORMS THAT HAD DEFEATED THEM.

THE NEXT PACT WITH THE DEVIL WAS EVEN MORE SHOCKING. FOR DECADES, MICROSOFT HAD WAGED A HOLY WAR AGAINST OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE, AND ITS GREATEST ENEMY WAS LINUX. STEVE BALLMER HAD FAMOUSLY CALLED LINUX "A CANCER." IT WAS THE SYMBOL OF EVERYTHING MICROSOFT HATED: FREE, COLLABORATIVE, AND A DIRECT THREAT TO THEIR PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE MODEL. NADELLA DID THE UNTHINKABLE. HE EMBRACED LINUX. HE ANNOUNCED THAT MICROSOFT AZURE, THEIR CLOUD PLATFORM, WOULD NOT ONLY SUPPORT LINUX, BUT IT WOULD TREAT IT AS A FIRST-CLASS CITIZEN. HE DECLARED "MICROSOFT LOVES LINUX." THIS WAS NOT A TRUCE. IT WAS A COMPLETE IDEOLOGICAL CAPITULATION. IT WAS A SIGNAL TO THE ENTIRE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY THAT THE OLD, WARLIKE MICROSOFT WAS DEAD. THE COMPANY THAT ONCE SOUGHT TO CRUSH AND EXTINGUISH OPEN SOURCE WAS NOW DESPERATE TO JOIN IT. THEY HAD TO. THE CLOUD WAS BEING BUILT ON OPEN-SOURCE TECHNOLOGIES, AND IF MICROSOFT REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE, THEY WOULD BE LEFT BEHIND TO DIE. NADELLA WAS FORCING HIS COMPANY TO ABANDON DECADES OF DOGMA AND HATRED IN A BRUTAL, PRAGMATIC QUEST FOR RELEVANCE.

THE WAR FOR THE CLOUD

ALL OF THESE PAINFUL, SELF-DESTRUCTIVE ACTS WERE DESIGNED TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR THE ONE BATTLE THAT TRULY MATTERED: THE WAR FOR THE CLOUD. AMAZON WEB SERVICES HAD A GIGANTIC, SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE LEAD. THEY HAD INVENTED THE MARKET. THEY DOMINATED IT. THEY WERE YEARS AHEAD IN TECHNOLOGY, SCALE, AND BRAND RECOGNITION. FOR MICROSOFT TO EVEN ATTEMPT TO COMPETE WAS SEEN BY MANY AS A SUICIDAL FOLLY.

BUT THIS WAS THE ONE AREA WHERE NADELLA HAD A DEEP, PERSONAL CONVICTION. HE HAD RUN THE BUSINESS. HE KNEW ITS POTENTIAL. HE POURED ALL OF THE COMPANY'S RESOURCES, ALL OF ITS TALENT, ALL OF ITS POLITICAL CAPITAL INTO A SINGLE, MONOMANIACAL GOAL: CATCHING AMAZON. IT WAS A BRUTAL, RELENTLESS, UPHILL BATTLE. AZURE WAS THE UNDERDOG. THEY HAD TO FIGHT FOR EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER. THEY HAD TO OUT-INNOVATE, OUT-SELL, AND OUT-PERFORM A RIVAL THAT WAS FIRMLY ENTRENCHED.

NADELLA LEVERAGED MICROSOFT’S ONLY REMAINING ADVANTAGE: ITS DEEP, LONGSTANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE WORLD'S LARGEST ENTERPRISES. WHILE AMAZON WAS POPULAR WITH STARTUPS AND DEVELOPERS, MICROSOFT HAD SPENT DECADES SELLING SOFTWARE TO EVERY FORTUNE 500 COMPANY ON THE PLANET. HE USED THIS FOOTHOLD TO WAGE A GUERRILLA WAR. HE BUNDLED AZURE SERVICES WITH EXISTING ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS. HE DISPATCHED HIS VAST SALESFORCE TO PERSUADE, CAJOLE, AND CONVINCE THEIR OLD CUSTOMERS TO MAKE THE LEAP TO THE MICROSOFT CLOUD.

IT WAS A WAR FOUGHT NOT JUST WITH TECHNOLOGY, BUT WITH TRUST. NADELLA POSITIONED MICROSOFT AS THE SAFE, RELIABLE PARTNER FOR BIG BUSINESS, CONTRASTING IT WITH AMAZON, WHICH HE SUBTLY PAINTED AS A COMPETITOR THAT MIGHT ONE DAY USE YOUR OWN DATA TO DESTROY YOUR BUSINESS. IT WAS A SLOW, PAINFUL, GRINDING WAR OF ATTRITION. EVERY QUARTER, THE NUMBERS WERE SCRUTINIZED. WAS AZURE GROWING FAST ENOUGH? WAS THE GAP CLOSING? THE PRESSURE WAS IMMENSE. THE ENTIRE FUTURE OF THE REVITALIZED MICROSOFT RESTED ON THE SUCCESS OF THIS ONE, MONUMENTAL GAMBLE. FAILURE WAS NOT AN OPTION. FAILURE MEANT A SLIDE BACK INTO IRRELEVANCE. FAILURE MEANT THE ENTIRE PAINFUL REFRESH HAD BEEN FOR NOTHING.

THE UNFINISHED REVOLUTION

THE TRANSFORMATION OF MICROSOFT UNDER SATYA NADELLA IS NOT A STORY WITH A HAPPY ENDING. IT IS A STORY WITH NO ENDING AT ALL. 'HIT REFRESH' IS NOT A BUTTON YOU PRESS ONCE. IT IS A STATE OF CONSTANT, NERVE-WRACKING VIGILANCE. THE COMPANY WAS DRAGGED BACK FROM THE BRINK OF DEATH, BUT THE FORCES THAT NEARLY KILLED IT ARE ALWAYS LURKING. THE NEXT DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY, THE NEXT CATASTROPHIC CULTURAL DECAY, IS ALWAYS JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

THE COMPANY IS NOW A TITAN AGAIN, VALUED IN THE TRILLIONS. BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF TITAN. IT IS A TITAN BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF HUMILITY AND PARANOIA. IT IS A TITAN THAT KNOWS, IN ITS VERY BONES, HOW QUICKLY IT CAN ALL BE DESTROYED. THE SUCCESS OF AZURE, THE RESURGENCE OF OFFICE, THE BOLD BETS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE—THESE ARE NOT VICTORIES. THEY ARE TEMPORARY RESPITES IN AN ETERNAL WAR.

THE BOOK 'HIT REFRESH' IS THEREFORE NOT A MEMOIR OF A JOB WELL DONE. IT IS A PERMANENT, UNYIELDING REMINDER OF THE AGONY OF CHANGE. IT IS A SCAR. IT IS A WARNING THAT THE MOMENT YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE INVINCIBLE IS THE EXACT MOMENT YOU BEGIN YOUR DESCENT INTO OBLIVION. THE REVOLUTION AT MICROSOFT IS UNFINISHED. IT MUST BE UNFINISHED. BECAUSE THE DAY THE STRUGGLE ENDS, THE DAY THE COMPANY STOPS HITTING REFRESH ON ITS OWN SOUL, IS THE DAY THE OLD POISON WILL INEVITABLY BEGIN TO SEEP BACK IN. AND THE FALL, NEXT TIME, WILL BE ABSOLUTE.
