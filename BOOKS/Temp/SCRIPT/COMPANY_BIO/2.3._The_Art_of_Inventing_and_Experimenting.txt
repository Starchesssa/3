Imagine you're trying to build something totally new, like a special kind of bike that flies. That's inventing. Now, imagine you build it, and it doesn't quite fly right. But you learn *why* it didn't, and you try again, making changes. That's experimenting.

At Amazon, Jeff Bezos made these two ideas – inventing and experimenting – a huge part of how the company works. It's like their secret sauce for growth and staying ahead.

So, what does "inventing" mean for Amazon? It's not just making an existing product a little bit better. It's about creating something that didn't exist before, something completely new that helps customers in a big way.

Think about it:
*   Before the **Kindle**, you bought physical books. Amazon didn't just make a faster way to deliver books. They invented a device just for reading digital books, making it super easy to carry a whole library. That was a big invention.
*   Another example is **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. This sounds technical, but it's basically Amazon renting out its massive computer power and data storage to other companies. No one was really doing this on a large scale before. It was a completely new business idea that Amazon created from their own needs.

Now, what about "experimenting"? This means trying out new ideas, even if you're not sure they'll work. It means being okay with things failing.

Think of it like a scientist in a lab. They mix different chemicals, some explode, some do nothing, but they keep trying until they find what works. Amazon tries a lot of things, and many of them don't work out.

*   Remember the **Amazon Fire Phone**? It was a phone they made, and it didn't sell well at all. It was a big flop. But Amazon learned from it. They took what they learned about voice technology and customer interaction from that failed phone project, and guess what came later? The **Echo and Alexa** smart speakers. Without that phone experiment, they might not have built the smart speaker that became so popular.

So, experimenting isn't just about success. It's about learning, even when you "fail." It's about being willing to take risks and not be afraid to try something that might not work out.

You can't really invent without experimenting. To create something new, you have to try different versions, test them, and learn from what doesn't work. And if you're just experimenting without a goal to invent something better, you might not get anywhere big.

Amazon believes that if you're not failing sometimes, you're not trying enough new things. They see failure as a necessary part of the path to big success and breakthroughs. They also think long-term. They know an invention or experiment might not pay off for years, but they stick with it if they believe it will serve customers in the end.

So, "The Art of Inventing and Experimenting" at Amazon is simply about:
*   Always trying to create genuinely new things.
*   Being brave enough to test those new ideas, knowing some won't work.
*   Learning from everything you try, especially the things that don't go as planned.
*   And doing it all with the customer in mind, looking to the future.
