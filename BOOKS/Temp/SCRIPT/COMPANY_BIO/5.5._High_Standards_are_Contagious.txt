Amazon discovered that high standards are incredibly contagious. When you raise the bar for your own work, and expect excellence from those around you, that commitment to quality spreads throughout the team. Itâ€™s a powerful force for improvement.

However, the opposite is also true: if you tolerate mediocrity, it can just as easily become the norm. For your company, this means every decision, every hire, and every project review is an opportunity to either elevate or lower your collective standards.

Focus on recruiting individuals who embody excellence. Continuously challenge yourselves and your team to deliver the absolute best. Your personal commitment to high standards isn't just about your own output; it shapes the entire culture and directly impacts the quality and success of everything you do. Be the catalyst for excellence.
