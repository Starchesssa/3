At Amazon, chapter five unveils a powerful truth: High Standards are Contagious. This isn't just about demanding excellence; it's about embedding it so deeply that it spreads organically. A prime example is Amazon's unique "bar raiser" hiring process. When a candidate is interviewed, a specially trained "bar raiser" from an unrelated team participates. Their sole job is to ensure that the new hire not only meets the current hiring bar but actually *raises* it. This commitment meant that every single person brought into the company elevates the overall quality and expectation. Itâ€™s an inspiring, almost shocking, dedication to perpetual improvement. If one person sets a high bar for detail in a document, or for the quality of a software release, that standard subtly yet powerfully influences everyone around them, creating a self-reinforcing loop where excellence becomes the norm.
