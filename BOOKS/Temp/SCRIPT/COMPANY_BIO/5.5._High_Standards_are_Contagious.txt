High standards mean you believe great work is possible and you teach it to others. It is not about working longer hours. It is about knowing what amazing work looks like. This belief spreads from one person to a team and then to a whole company. Think about Amazon Web Services, or AWS. This service was first built to fix Amazon's own website problems. They set an extremely high standard for their internal computer network. It had to be almost 100 percent reliable and very efficient. This internal standard was so successful that they decided to offer it to other companies in 2006. By the year 2021, AWS was making 62.2 billion dollars in revenue. This amount was only 13 percent of Amazon's total sales. But it generated over 74 percent of Amazon's entire operating profit for that year. A high standard set for one small team spread to the outside world. It created a business that powers a huge part of the internet today.
