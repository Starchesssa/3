High standards mean you know what great work looks like before you begin. It is not about working longer hours. It is about the quality of the result. At Amazon, this belief spreads from one person to the whole team. A lack of high standards can be a disaster.

Consider the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 launch in 2016. The phone had a major flaw where batteries would explode. This was a clear failure in manufacturing and safety standards. The company had to recall 2.5 million phones globally. This single issue erased about 19 billion dollars from Samsung's market value. The companyâ€™s mobile division profit for that quarter dropped by 96 percent compared to the previous year.

This shows that a high standard is not a vague idea. It has a real financial cost when ignored. Setting the bar high from the start protects customers and the company. Everyone on a team must see and understand what "great" means. This is how excellence becomes the normal routine.
