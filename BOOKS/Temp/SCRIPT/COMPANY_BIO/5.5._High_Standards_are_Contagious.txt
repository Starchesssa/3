"High Standards are Contagious" means that when a few people demand really good quality and effort, others around them naturally start to do the same. It's like excellence spreading from one person to another. For example, if Amazon's website loads slowly, say, 100 milliseconds slower, that can reduce customer engagement by 7%. This small delay might lead to a 1% drop in sales for a specific product, impacting revenue by millions over time. Because of this, engineers and designers learned to build incredibly fast, reliable systems. When a new engineer joins, they see their colleagues consistently delivering code with 99.99% uptime and minimal bugs. This environment sets a high bar. Suddenly, the new engineer also starts aiming for that same high level of quality, not just "good enough." They realize that fixing a bug early, before it affects even 0.01% of customers, is crucial because that small percentage could still mean thousands of unhappy users and a potential 0.5% dip in product reviews, directly affecting future purchases. This constant striving for perfection, set by a few, makes everyone better.
