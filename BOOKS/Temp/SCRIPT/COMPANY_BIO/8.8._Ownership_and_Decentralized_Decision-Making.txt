Amazon's philosophy of "Ownership and Decentralized Decision-Making" revolutionized how a large company could remain agile. Jeff Bezos famously introduced the "two-pizza team" rule: if a team couldn't be fed by two pizzas, it was too large. This wasn't just about size, but about empowering small groups to make critical decisions independently, without constant top-down approval. Each team was expected to act like true owners of their projects, taking full responsibility for their long-term outcomes. This radical decentralization was key to Amazon's incredible pace of innovation. For example, the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) was largely thanks to these autonomous teams, who could iterate and launch features with speed. It instilled a deep sense of personal investment, allowing the company to move quickly, even as it scaled globally, fostering a culture where every employee felt empowered to drive success.
