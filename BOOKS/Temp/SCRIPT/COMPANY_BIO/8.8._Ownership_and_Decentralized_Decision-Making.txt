Amazonâ€™s principle of decentralized decision-making, like their 'two-pizza teams,' empowers small units to act quickly. This can lead to rapid innovation. For instance, a team might push out a new feature within a month, boosting engagement by 15% in their specific product category. However, this autonomy also carries risks. In one hypothetical scenario, a decentralized team, acting on its own, might have invested $20 million into a niche product that, despite its potential, only achieved a 0.2% market penetration, resulting in a 1% dip in the broader division's quarterly profits. This demonstrates the critical balance: while you must empower your teams to own decisions and move fast, providing clear strategic alignment is paramount. Without it, individual initiatives, though well-intentioned, could lead to a cumulative 5-10% of annual budget being spent on misaligned projects across various teams. So, equip your teams with decision-making power, but also ensure they understand the larger company's financial and strategic north star.
