Amazon instills a deep sense of ownership, where everyone acts like a proprietor, not just an employee. This means taking full responsibility and making decisions as if it were your own business. They championed decentralized decision-making, empowering smaller 'two-pizza teams' to operate autonomously. This avoids the slow, top-down approval processes common in many companies. For you, this is a crucial lesson: give your teams the freedom and authority to make important choices. It fosters incredible speed, innovation, and accountability. When you trust your people to own their projects, you unlock their full potential, preventing bottlenecks and accelerating progress. Itâ€™s inspiring to see how this approach allowed Amazon to move with the agility of a startup, even at massive scale.
