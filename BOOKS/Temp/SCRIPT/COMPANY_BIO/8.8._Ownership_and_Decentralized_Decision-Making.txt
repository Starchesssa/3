Imagine you own a small part of a huge company, but you get to make all the important decisions for it. This is what Amazon calls "ownership." To make this work, they use a rule called "two-pizza teams." If a team is too big to be fed by two pizzas, it's too slow to make decisions. Small teams get to act like owners of their specific project.

Let's look at a company that did the opposite. In 2007, Nokia held nearly 50% of the global smartphone market. But by 2013, its market share had plummeted by over 90% to below 5%. A major reason was its slow, centralized decision-making. Ideas had to pass through too many layers of management, and by the time they were approved, the market had already moved on.

In contrast, Amazon Web Services (AWS) started as a small, independent "two-pizza team" project. They were given ownership to solve a problem. In 2023, AWS generated over $90 billion in revenue. While this was only about 16% of Amazon's total sales, it accounted for over 60% of the company's entire operating profit. This single, decentralized team created a business more profitable than the rest of Amazon combined, showing the incredible power of ownership.
