Ownership and Decentralized Decision-Making means employees act like they own their work, making decisions quickly without needing constant approval from the top. Itâ€™s like small, focused groups making choices for their project, rather than waiting for a large central command.

Amazon emphasizes "Two-Pizza Teams." These are small teams, around 6-10 people, given full responsibility for their projects. This freedom allowed Amazon to innovate much faster. For instance, the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) was a direct result of this. Small, empowered teams built different services independently. This quick, decentralized approach helped AWS capture a huge market, reaching about 31% of the global cloud market by 2023 and generating tens of billions in annual revenue. Without this decentralized model, development would have been far slower, potentially delaying market entry by years and allowing competitors to gain a significant advantage, potentially reducing AWS's market share by 15-20% and its revenue by similar proportions in its early crucial growth period.
