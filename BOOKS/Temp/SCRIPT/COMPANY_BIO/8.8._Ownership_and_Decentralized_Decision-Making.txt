Ownership and Decentralized Decision-Making means every employee thinks and acts like a true owner, responsible for long-term outcomes, not just immediate tasks. This mindset is coupled with pushing decision-making authority down to small, autonomous teams. For instance, Amazon's famed "two-pizza teams," usually 5-7 people, are empowered to make critical decisions without extensive hierarchical approvals. This accelerates development, reducing decision cycles by an estimated 30-40% compared to traditional large-team structures.

A prime example is the birth and scaling of AWS. Initially, small, independent teams were given the autonomy to build and iterate on cloud services. This decentralized approach allowed for rapid experimentation and launch. AWS, which officially launched in 2006, has grown exponentially, contributing an astounding $9.2 billion in operating income in Q4 2023, representing 66% of Amazon's total operating income. This massive success is a direct result of fostering ownership and empowering teams to innovate independently, proving that pushing decision-making down significantly boosts both speed and profitability.
