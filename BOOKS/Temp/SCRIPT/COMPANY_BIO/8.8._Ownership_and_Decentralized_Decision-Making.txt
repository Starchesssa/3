Ownership means every employee acts like the company is theirs. Decentralized decision-making means small teams can make big choices fast. This avoids slow approvals from the top. Consider the story of Kodak. In 1975, a Kodak engineer invented the first digital camera. But top bosses, who made every single decision, feared it would hurt film sales. Film sales made up 85 percent of their revenue. The engineer's team had no ownership or power to push the new invention. Because of this slow, centralized thinking, they missed the digital revolution completely. From its peak value in 1997, Kodak's stock price dropped by over 99 percent. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2012. On one single day in January 2012, the stock fell 30 percent. This shows how one centralized decision, blocking a team with a great idea, can destroy a company that was worth 31 billion dollars. A small team with real ownership could have changed that history.
