Imagine a company where small teams make huge choices. This is called decentralized decision-making. Each team member acts like an owner of their project. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, started exactly this way. A small team inside Amazon saw a problem with their computer infrastructure. They were given the ownership to build a solution without asking top bosses for permission at every step. This project launched in 2006. By 2015, its operating profit was about $1.9 billion for the year. By 2022, that number exploded to $22.8 billion. In just one quarter of 2021, AWS earned an operating profit of $5.3 billion. During that same time, the rest of Amazon recorded an operating loss of $1.8 billion. This means the small team's idea generated well over 100 percent of the entire company's profit. One decentralized team's project became so successful it financially supported the whole of Amazon. This shows the incredible power of letting people own their work.
