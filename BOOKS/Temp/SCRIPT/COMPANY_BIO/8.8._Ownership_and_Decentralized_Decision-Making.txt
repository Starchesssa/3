Amazon champions ownership, where everyone acts like a proprietor, responsible for long-term results, not just their immediate job. This is powered by decentralized decision-making. Think of their famous 'two-pizza teams' â€“ small, autonomous groups, ideally fed by two pizzas, who own a project completely.

Amazon empowers these teams to make decisions quickly, close to the customer, avoiding bottlenecks and speeding up innovation. For instance, a team could launch a new website feature without layers of approval. This approach trusts those closest to the problem.

For you: Empower your teams with real decision-making authority, fostering accountability and agility. Don't be afraid of small, fast failures. And personally, adopt that owner's mindset; treat your projects as if they were your own business. This drives rapid, informed action.
