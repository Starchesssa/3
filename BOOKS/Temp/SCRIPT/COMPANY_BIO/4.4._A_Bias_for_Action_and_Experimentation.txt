Amazon believes in moving fast. This isn't about rushing blindly, but about having a 'bias for action and experimentation.' Instead of endless planning, they launch, learn, and iterate.

Consider the Amazon Kindle. Before it existed, no one knew if people would embrace e-readers. Amazon didn't wait for a perfect market survey; they built the device, launched it, and observed how customers used it. This quick action and willingness to experiment with a new product category led to a revolutionary success, transforming reading and establishing them in hardware.

But it’s not just about successes. The Fire Phone, launched in 2014, was a significant *failure*. It didn't resonate with customers. Instead of dwelling on the loss, Amazon quickly absorbed the lessons about product market fit and user experience. This rapid experimentation, even when it resulted in a misstep, fueled later innovations like the Echo.

So, for you, this means don't be afraid to try. Don't wait for perfection to take the first step. Launch your idea, test it, and learn from the results – good or bad. Every action, every experiment, moves you forward, providing invaluable data for your next move.
