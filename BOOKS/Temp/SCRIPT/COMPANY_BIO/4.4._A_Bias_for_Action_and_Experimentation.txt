Amazon's idea of a 'bias for action' is simple: speed matters more than being perfect. They believe that if you wait to have 90% of the information you need, you're already too late. Itâ€™s better to make a decision with just 70% of the information and then quickly correct course if you're wrong. Most decisions can be undone.

A shocking example is the Amazon Fire Phone. In 2014, Amazon launched it to compete with Apple. It was a massive failure. Within just two months, the price dropped from $199 to 99 cents with a contract. The experiment cost them dearly. In the third quarter of 2014, Amazon announced a charge of $170 million just because of unsold phones and supplier costs. This one failure contributed heavily to a total company loss of $437 million that quarter.

But this is where the lesson shines. The failure wasn't a waste. The team and technology behind the failed phone were used to create something new: the Amazon Echo and Alexa. That project became a huge success, generating an estimated $10 billion in revenue just a few years later. The costly phone experiment directly led to a product that now sits in millions of homes. They acted, failed big, and learned even bigger.
