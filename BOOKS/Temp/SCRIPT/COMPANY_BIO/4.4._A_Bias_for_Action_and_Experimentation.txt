Amazon knew that waiting for perfect information often meant missing opportunities. They developed a "bias for action" â€“ preferring to make a reasonable decision and move forward, rather than getting stuck in endless analysis paralysis. Imagine not debating the perfect path, but picking a good one and starting, then observing and adjusting.

They also embraced "experimentation." This wasn't about wild guesses, but designing small, reversible tests. If a new idea didn't work, they learned quickly and tried something else. For you, this means don't let the pursuit of perfection or fear of failure prevent progress. Take that first step. Launch a small test. Use the results to inform your next move, fostering rapid learning and innovation within your own work.
