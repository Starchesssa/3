Amazon believes speed matters more than perfection in business. You should make a decision when you have about 70 percent of the information you wish you had. Waiting for 90 percent or more means you are probably being too slow. This means trying things and sometimes failing in a big way. The Amazon Fire Phone in 2014 is a perfect example of this. It was a massive commercial failure. The company took a financial hit of $170 million in one quarter because of the phone. They had $83 million worth of unsold phones sitting in warehouses. After announcing this loss, Amazon's stock dropped almost 10 percent in a single day. This failure was huge and public. But the engineers from that failed project were moved to a new team. That team created the Amazon Echo and the Alexa voice assistant. By 2021, the Echo commanded nearly 70 percent of the U.S. smart speaker market. A $170 million failure directly fueled a multi-billion dollar success story. This shows that quick action, even when it leads to failure, can create incredible new opportunities.
