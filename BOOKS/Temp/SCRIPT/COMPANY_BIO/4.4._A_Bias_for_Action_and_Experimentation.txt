"A Bias for Action and Experimentation" means you move quickly, trying things out rather than waiting for perfect information. It's about launching ideas, seeing what happens, and then learning and adapting fast. You accept that not every attempt will succeed, but each experiment provides valuable knowledge.

Amazon shows this clearly with the Fire Phone, launched in 2014. This was a bold experiment in hardware. It didn't achieve market success, leading Amazon to report a $170 million charge for unsold inventory in the third quarter of 2014. This contributed to a 23% decline in their net income that quarter. However, Amazon didn't view this as a total failure. They quickly took action to end production, critically analyzed what didn't work, and used those insights to develop later, more successful devices like the Echo. The financial loss was a cost of learning, which fueled future, profitable innovations. This demonstrates that taking action, even when it leads to a setback, provides essential data for future invention and progress.
