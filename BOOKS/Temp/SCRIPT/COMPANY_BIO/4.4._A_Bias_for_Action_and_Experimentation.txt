The lesson of a bias for action and experimentation highlights that speed often trumps perfection. Amazon exemplified this with the launch of the Kindle. When they decided to enter the hardware market with an e-reader, it was a significant leap from their core retail business. They didn't wait for a perfect product or 100% market certainty.

The first Kindle launched in November 2007 and sold out in just 5.5 hours. This initial success wasn't guaranteed; it was a high-stakes experiment. By taking this bold action, Amazon captured a nascent market. Within three years, by 2010, they were selling millions of devices, and by mid-2011, their e-book sales surpassed physical book sales, showing growth rates often exceeding 100% annually. This strategic pivot significantly impacted their valuation; Amazon's stock price saw an increase of over 150% between 2007 and 2011, fueled by such successful new ventures.

For you, this means not being paralyzed by needing complete data. If you wait for a 95% certainty, you might miss a market opportunity that could generate billions. Instead, act on an 80% certainty, test your assumptions quickly, and be prepared for some experiments to yield minimal returns. The potential 10x or 100x gains from successful innovations, like the Kindle's impact, far outweigh the costs of smaller, learning-oriented failures.
