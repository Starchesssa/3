Amazon understands that over-thinking can kill momentum. Instead of waiting for 100% certainty, they operate with a strong "bias for action." This means making decisions and taking steps forward, even with incomplete information. Their philosophy is often to launch and learn, rather than perfectly plan and miss an opportunity.

They treat new initiatives as experiments. A prime example is Amazon Web Services, AWS. It began as an internal tool, but Amazon took the bold action to externalize it as an experiment for developers. By quickly releasing it and constantly experimenting with new features based on feedback, they transformed it from a side project into an industry-defining cloud computing giant. This willingness to act quickly, learn, and iterate is fundamental to their continuous innovation and success.
