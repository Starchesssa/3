Amazon champions "A Bias for Action and Experimentation," meaning they prioritize rapid decision-making and testing, even with incomplete information, over waiting for perfect data. The philosophy is that 70% certainty is enough to proceed, because learning from action is faster than paralysis by analysis.

A powerful success example is the launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Recognizing an internal capability, Amazon swiftly made it available externally in 2006, not waiting for a fully mature market. This bold, early action resulted in a massive lead. By Q1 2023, AWS, while representing about 16% of Amazon's total net sales, contributed an incredible 62% of the company's operating income, showcasing the exponential returns of early action and continuous experimentation.

On the other hand, the Fire Phone in 2014 was a notable experiment that didn't succeed. Amazon took a substantial $170 million inventory writedown in Q3 2014, leading to a temporary 7% dip in Amazon's stock price following the earnings report. Yet, this wasn't a lost cause. The insights gained from this hardware failure were crucial, informing the development of later, highly successful products like the Echo. This illustrates that for Amazon, experimentation embraces failure as an essential data point, not a definitive end, fueling future invention.
