Imagine Amazon, not as a global giant, but as a small startup, every single day. That's the core of the Day 1 Mentality. It's about maintaining the fierce energy, the relentless customer focus, and the hunger to invent, even as the company grew enormous. Jeff Bezos passionately believed that Day 2 is when stagnation, complacency, and decline set in.

Think about the launch of Amazon Web Services, AWS. Here was a company known for selling books and goods, venturing into cloud computing â€“ a completely new and unproven territory for them. This wasn't a cautious step; it was a bold, startup-like leap, driven by the same experimental, customer-obsessed spirit you'd expect from a scrappy new company. They didn't rest on their retail laurels; they innovated as if their survival depended on it, just like it did on their very first day of business.
