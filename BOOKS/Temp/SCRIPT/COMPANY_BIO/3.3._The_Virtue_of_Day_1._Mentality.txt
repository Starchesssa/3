Imagine your company is always on its first day of business. That's the "Day 1" mentality. It means you're always learning, moving fast, and ready to invent. The opposite is "Day 2," which is when a company becomes slow, comfortable, and eventually fades away.

A powerful example of this is Amazon’s Fire Phone in 2014. It was a massive failure. After its launch, the company had to record a $170 million loss almost entirely due to unsold phones and supplier costs. In October 2014, when this loss was announced, Amazon's stock price plummeted by more than 8% in a single day of trading.

A "Day 2" company would have seen this as a disaster and stopped taking big risks. But Amazon used its Day 1 thinking. They didn't punish the team. Instead, they took the expensive lessons learned from building the phone’s hardware and voice recognition technology.

Just five months after discontinuing the Fire Phone, Amazon launched the Echo smart speaker, powered by Alexa. The Echo was built by many of the same engineers who worked on the failed phone. This new device created an entirely new market and is now a multi-billion dollar business. That $170 million failure was the price for the invention of something far more successful.
