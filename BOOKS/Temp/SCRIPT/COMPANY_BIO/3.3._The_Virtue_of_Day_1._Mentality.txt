The Day 1 mentality means treating every day like it is the first day of your company. You are a small startup, hungry for success. The opposite is Day 2. Day 2 is when a company gets big, slow, and stops listening to customers. This is the beginning of the end.

Consider the company Kodak. In 1975, Kodak invented the very first digital camera. But they were making billions from selling film. They feared that digital photography would destroy more than 60 percent of their film business. This was Day 2 thinking. They tried to protect their old business instead of inventing a new one.

In 1997, Kodak was a giant worth 31 billion dollars. They ignored the digital trend they started. Other companies took the idea and ran with it. By January 2012, Kodak's stock had collapsed by over 99 percent. The company filed for bankruptcy. This massive failure, losing almost all its value, was because they moved to Day 2. They stopped acting like it was the first day.
