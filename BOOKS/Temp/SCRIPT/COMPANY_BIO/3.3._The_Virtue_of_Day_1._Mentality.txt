The Virtue of Day 1. Mentality emphasizes fighting complacency and constantly innovating as if your company just started. Amazon exemplifies this by continuously challenging its own success. Consider the launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006. At that time, Amazon was primarily an e-commerce giant. Betting on cloud computing was a significant, unproven Day 1 decision. This wasn't a small venture; it required massive upfront investment without immediate returns.

By Q4 2023, AWS alone reported $24.2 billion in revenue, growing 13% year-over-year, and contributed over 60% of Amazon's total operating income. This demonstrates the power of maintaining a Day 1 mindset. For you, this means resisting the comfort of your current successes. If your core business is seeing 15% annual growth, don't stop exploring new, potentially disruptive ideas, even if they initially generate zero revenue. That early, seemingly small investment, like AWS was, could evolve to become the dominant revenue driver, accounting for over 50% of your future profit, purely because you dared to stay in Day 1 mode.
