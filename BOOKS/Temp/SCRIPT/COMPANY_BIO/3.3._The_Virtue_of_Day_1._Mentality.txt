The Day 1 Mentality means approaching every single day as if your company just started. It's about keeping the urgency, fresh thinking, and deep focus on the customer that a small startup has, even when you become a giant. The opposite is a 'Day 2' company, which means slowing down, getting comfortable, and becoming less innovative.

Amazon strongly believes that staying in 'Day 1' is crucial to avoid decline. For example, even after being a major online retailer for over a decade, Amazon launched Amazon Web Services, or AWS, in 2006. This was a completely new business, betting big on cloud computing. By 2023, AWS, while making up only about 16% of Amazonâ€™s total net sales, contributed over 62% of its total operating income. This wasn't a tweak; it was a massive reinvention.

This constant push to invent and operate like a startup, even when its market value hit over $1 trillion, helped Amazon avoid the common trap where large companies often see their growth rates slow significantly, sometimes by as much as 30% annually after reaching a certain size, because they lose their Day 1 edge. It's about always being restless, always experimenting, and never settling.
