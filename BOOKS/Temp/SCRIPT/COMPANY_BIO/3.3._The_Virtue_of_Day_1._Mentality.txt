Day 1 Mentality means always acting like a startup, regardless of your size. It’s about maintaining the urgency, innovation, and relentless customer focus you had on your very first day. Amazon embraces this to avoid what they call "Day 2" – a state of stasis, decline, and ultimately, irrelevance.

A prime example is Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the early 2000s, instead of merely optimizing their successful e-commerce business, Amazon chose a radical 'Day 1' path. They decided to open up their internal computing infrastructure as a service to other businesses. This wasn't an easy or obvious choice; it was a completely new venture that treated their own resources as a startup opportunity, leading to the multi-billion dollar cloud computing leader we know today.

For you, this means constantly questioning the status quo. Don't let past successes breed complacency. Ask yourself: "If I were starting today, how would I do this better?" Are you still innovating with the same hunger as if your existence depends on it? Avoid the "Day 2" trap of just maintaining what works. Keep that beginner's mindset, the willingness to invent, experiment, and even pivot, because that's where true, sustainable growth resides.
