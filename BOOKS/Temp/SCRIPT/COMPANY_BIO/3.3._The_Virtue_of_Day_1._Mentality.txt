Day 1 is the idea that a company must always act like a new startup. Day 2 is when a company becomes slow, comfortable, and stops inventing. The Unknown Company learned about Day 2 in 2014 with its failed product, the Omni-Home device. The project was stuck in development for five years, three years longer than planned. Internal data shows over 500 meetings were held just to decide on the device's shape. This slow process was a classic sign of Day 2 thinking.

Upon its release, the Omni-Home was a commercial disaster. The company projected sales of 1 million units in the first quarter. They sold only 40,000 units, which is just 4 percent of their target. The financial impact was immediate and severe. The company's stock fell from $300 to $180 per share in the six months following the launch. That is a 40 percent drop in value. The project resulted in a total loss of over 750 million dollars. This single failure accounted for nearly 60 percent of the company's total profit decline that fiscal year. This painful lesson forced the company to reject Day 2 and live permanently in Day 1.
