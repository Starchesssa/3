To invent big things, you must be willing to fail in a big way. Amazon believes that if you are not failing, you are not trying enough new ideas. This is not just a saying, it has a mathematical cost. Take the Amazon Fire Phone from 2014. The company lost a huge amount of money on this project. They reported a write-down of 170 million dollars just on unsold phones. After this news in October 2014, Amazon's stock price dropped by nearly 10 percent in a single day. The phone's price with a contract was cut from 199 dollars to just 99 cents. That is a price drop of over 99 percent. This failure was public and very expensive. But the work on the Fire Phone directly helped create the Amazon Echo. The team's failure with the phone provided lessons that made the Echo a massive success. The Echo sold over 20 million units within its first three years. So, the 170 million dollar failure led to a new product line worth billions. For Amazon, a few big failures are a necessary cost for one giant success.
