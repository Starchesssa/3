Imagine you try something ten times. Nine times you fail, but the one time you succeed, you earn 100 times more than all your failures cost. This is how Amazon sees invention. They believe you must fail to invent.

Let's look at the Amazon Fire Phone. In 2014, Amazon launched it after spending millions. The result was a disaster. They were left with so many unsold phones that in just three months, they had to report a loss of $170 million. The day after this news, Amazon's stock price dropped by about 8%. It was a public and financial failure.

But the story doesn't end there. The small team and the technology developed for that failed phone were used to create something new: the Amazon Echo, powered by Alexa.

The Echo was a massive success. It quickly captured over 60% of the smart speaker market in its early years. That $170 million loss from the phone became the cost of entry for creating a multi-billion-dollar business with Alexa. Amazon believes that if you aren't failing, you aren't experimenting enough to find the next big thing.
