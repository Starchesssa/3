To invent truly new things, you must accept and even embrace failure as a necessary step. Itâ€™s not about avoiding mistakes, but about learning from them to pave the way for future success. Amazon operates on the principle that big innovations demand a high tolerance for failed experiments.

Consider the Amazon Fire Phone, launched in 2014. This was a significant commercial failure for the company. Amazon had to record a $170 million write-down for unsold inventory. The phone's price quickly plummeted from $199 to just 99 cents within months of its release. This directly contributed to Amazon reporting an operating loss of $544 million in Q3 2014, a sharp decline from the $41 million profit in the same quarter the previous year. While the Fire Phone itself had about a 0% success rate in the market, the valuable technical learnings and team experience from that project were directly channeled into the development of the highly successful Echo devices and Alexa voice assistant. This initial failure became a 100% learning opportunity that eventually led to a multi-billion dollar product line. Every such 'failure' is just data, pointing towards the next big invention.
