Amazon understands that truly inventing something new means you'll fail a lot. They see failure not as a problem, but as an essential part of the process. Think about the Fire Phone. It was a significant financial and critical flop. Many companies would shy away from future hardware after such a blow. But Amazon didn't. Instead, they meticulously analyzed what went wrong, gathered those learnings, and applied them to future innovations. This willingness to embrace and learn from failure directly contributed to the success of products like the Echo and Alexa. For you, this means don't be paralyzed by the fear of making mistakes. Take bold risks, experiment often, and view every 'failure' as valuable data. It's not about avoiding failure, but about learning quickly from it and trying again. That's how real breakthroughs happen.
