Amazon understands a profound truth: truly big inventions don't happen without big risks, and big risks often lead to big failures. They don't just tolerate failure; they see it as a necessary step on the path to groundbreaking innovation. Think about it: if you're not failing, it often means you're not trying anything audacious enough.

For your company, this means fostering an environment where experimentation is encouraged, even if the outcome isn't always a success. Don't let the fear of a misstep stop you from pursuing bold new ideas. Instead, view every setback as valuable data, a lesson learned that brings you closer to your next major breakthrough. Embrace failure not as an endpoint, but as a critical stepping stone, propelling you towards genuine invention.
