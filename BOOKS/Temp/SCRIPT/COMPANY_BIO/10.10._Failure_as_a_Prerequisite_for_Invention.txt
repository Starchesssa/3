Chapter 10, 'Failure as a Prerequisite for Invention,' teaches us that true innovation isn't a straight line to success. Amazon famously launched the Fire Phone in 2014, a significant hardware venture. Within months, its initial $199 price point plummeted to $0.99. This wasn't a small misstep; Amazon absorbed a $170 million write-down in unsold inventory during the third quarter of 2014, a direct financial consequence of this product's market rejection. This huge loss, however, didn't stop them. It became a crucial learning experience, feeding into their development of later, highly successful devices like the Echo. For you, this means understanding that a 70% or even 90% project failure rate isn't a sign of incompetence, but often an unavoidable part of pushing boundaries. Don't let a significant setback, like a project costing a percentage of your annual budget, deter your long-term inventive spirit. Embrace these 'failures' as data points, essential steps on the path to groundbreaking achievements.
