To invent, you must be willing to fail. For every 100 new ideas, 99 might not work. The company Unknown learned this lesson the hard way. In 2011, they launched a device called the 'Fire Phone'. They invested over $170 million into its development. The company projected sales of 2 million phones in the first six months. They sold fewer than 35,000 phones in total. This represented a failure of over 98 percent compared to their goal. The company had to write off $170 million in losses because of unsold phones. On October 23rd, 2014, the day this loss was announced, the company's stock dropped almost 10 percent. This single event accounted for nearly 40 percent of the stock's value drop that entire quarter. However, the teams that worked on the Fire Phone were not fired. The knowledge gained from that massive failure was used to create future products. The small team that developed the phone's voice features went on to build the Alexa voice service. This service now powers tens of millions of devices and generates billions in revenue. A billion-dollar success was born directly from a $170 million failure.
