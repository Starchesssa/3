Amazon views failure not as a drawback, but as a critical stepping stone to invention. Take the Fire Phone, for instance. Launched in 2014, it was a multi-hundred-million-dollar failure, a significant blow for the company. Yet, Amazon didn't simply bury it. They meticulously analyzed why it failed: the pricing, the market timing, the lack of compelling features.

This deep dive into its shortcomings directly informed the development of subsequent hardware. The lessons learned from the Fire Phone's interface and marketing, for example, were invaluable in shaping the Amazon Echo and Alexa, which became massive successes.

What does this mean for you? Don't shy away from projects that might not work. Amazon makes huge, risky bets knowing many will fail because the few that succeed can change the world. When your own efforts fall short, don't see it as defeat. Instead, actively dissect what went wrong. Ask: What did we learn here? What new insights did this "failure" provide that we can apply to our next endeavor? By doing this, you transform every misstep into a powerful data point, fueling your path towards true innovation. If you're not failing, you're likely not experimenting enough.
