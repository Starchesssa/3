Amazon embraces failure not as a setback, but as a necessary stepping stone for groundbreaking invention. Think of the Fire Phone. Launched in 2014, it was a major, public failure, costing hundreds of millions and quickly discontinued. Many saw it as a disaster. Yet, Amazon learned invaluable lessons from that experience. The technology, the engineers, and the insights gained from attempting such a bold product were not discarded. Instead, elements of that ambitious project, like its computer vision and voice recognition capabilities, found new life. This learning helped pave the way for successful innovations like the Echo and Alexa. For Amazon, every significant invention demands experimentation, and with experimentation comes a high probability of things not working out. Itâ€™s through these bold attempts and the lessons from their failures that truly transformative ideas emerge and eventually thrive.
