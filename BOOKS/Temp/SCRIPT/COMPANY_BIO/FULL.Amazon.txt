There is a playbook that separates the 1% from the 99%.

It is not a secret guarded by old men in smokey rooms.

It is a story.

The story of a company that started in a garage and ended up in almost every home on the planet.

I have just finished reading a fascinating book on the subject.

It is called 'Amazon' and the lessons inside are not what you think.

This is not about selling books online.

This is about a blueprint for building an empire in the modern world.

And today, we will dissect that blueprint.

KEY LESSON: PROFIT IS A PATIENCE GAME.

The story begins in 1999.

The world was high on the promise of the internet.

It was the Dot-com bubble.

Companies with no products and no revenue were worth billions of dollars.

And Amazon was the king of this new world.

It was the poster child for the digital gold rush.

Jeff Bezos was even named Time Magazine's Person of the Year.

The company's stock was on an insane upward climb, gaining over 5,500% in the prior two years.

But underneath the excitement, a dangerous question was being whispered.

Where is the money.

Wall Street analysts, the so-called experts, started to look at Amazon's books.

They saw massive revenue growth.

But they also saw massive losses.

For every dollar of books it sold, it was spending more.

The media turned on them.

They started calling the company Amazon.bomb.

Then the bubble burst.

The party was over.

Tech stocks everywhere collapsed.

Amazon's stock was annihilated.

It fell from a high of over $100 per share all the way down to less than $6.

It lost more than 90% of its value.

Everyone expected them to die.

They were just another Dot-com failure waiting to happen.

But Bezos had a different plan.

He ignored the noise.

He ignored the stock price.

He focused on one thing.

The customer.

He kept lowering prices.

He kept improving the website.

He introduced free shipping.

He burned through cash with a singular belief that if you build the best experience, the profits will eventually come.

For years, they bled.

Then, in 2003, something quietly happened.

The company released its financial results for the full year.

For the first time in its history, Amazon reported a full-year profit.

It was not a huge number.

It was only $35.3 million.

But it was everything.

It was proof.

It proved that the model worked.

It proved that patience and a relentless focus on the customer was the winning strategy.

The critics were silenced.

The company had survived the storm and emerged stronger.

The lesson is brutal and simple.

The market wants profits today.

True visionaries build for profits a decade from now.

KEY LESSON: BUILD THE TOOLS, THEN SELL THE TOOLS.

By 2006, Amazon was a dominant force in e-commerce.

To run a website that big, they had to solve incredible technical problems.

They needed massive amounts of computing power.

They needed databases that could handle millions of transactions.

They needed a global network that was always online.

So they built it themselves.

They built one of the most sophisticated and efficient computing infrastructures on the planet.

For any other company, this would just be a cost.

A very, very big expense needed to run the main business.

But inside Amazon, a radical idea started to form.

Their engineers realized their internal system was so good, other companies could use it too.

What if they rented out their excess server space and computing power.

What if they turned their biggest expense into a brand new product.

Most executives would have dismissed the idea.

They were in the business of selling physical goods, not digital infrastructure.

It was a distraction.

But Amazon was different.

In 2006, they quietly launched a new service.

It was called Amazon Web Services, or AWS.

At first, nobody really understood it.

It was a service for developers and startups.

But it was a game-changer.

Instead of buying expensive servers, a new company could now rent computing power from Amazon for pennies.

This simple idea fueled the next decade of tech innovation.

Companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and Slack were all built on top of AWS.

Then, in 2008, the global financial crisis hit.

The entire world economy was collapsing.

Consumer spending dried up.

But something strange happened with Amazon.

While other retailers were going bankrupt, Amazonâ€™s sales grew by 29% that year.

And AWS became even more critical.

Businesses, desperate to cut costs, stopped buying their own hardware and moved to Amazon's cloud.

What started as an internal tool became a profit engine.

By 2022, AWS would be a business segment generating over $80 billion in annual revenue.

For many years, AWS produced more operating profit than the entire North American retail business combined.

They built the tools for themselves.

Then they sold those tools to the rest of the world, including their own competitors.

That is how you build a fortress.

KEY LESSON: IT IS ALWAYS DAY ONE.

Fast forward to 2017.

Amazon is no longer a bookstore.

It is an everything store.

It is a cloud computing giant.

It is a movie studio.

It is a hardware maker with the Kindle and Echo.

The company was worth over half a trillion dollars.

It would have been easy to get comfortable.

To become slow.

To become a "Day 2" company.

In Bezos's mind, Day 2 is stasis.

Followed by irrelevance.

Followed by a painful, agonizing decline.

Followed by death.

So he insisted that it must always be Day 1.

Day 1 means you act like a startup.

You are hungry.

You experiment.

You are willing to fail.

And in 2017, they made a move that proved they were still on Day 1.

They targeted an industry they had very little experience in.

An industry with razor-thin profit margins and complex physical logistics.

Groceries.

They had tried and struggled with this market before.

But this time, they did not just experiment.

They went all in.

On June 16, 2017, Amazon announced it was acquiring Whole Foods Market.

The price tag was $13.7 billion.

It was a shockwave.

The stock market panicked.

On the day of the announcement, the top grocery competitors in the United States lost a combined $12 billion in market value.

Amazon, the king of online, was now a major player in physical, brick-and-mortar stores.

It was a declaration of war on a whole new industry.

This aggressive mindset also brought new problems.

By 2019, the company was facing intense scrutiny.

There were headlines about harsh working conditions in its warehouses.

There were political calls to break up the company.

Bezos himself was going through a very public divorce.

Being a giant made them a giant target.

But the core lesson remained.

To stay on top, you can never believe you are on top.

You must have the paranoia and hunger of a brand-new company, even when you are one of the biggest in the world.

It must always be Day 1.

KEY LESSON: GRAVITY ALWAYS WINS.

The world changed in 2020.

The pandemic turned Amazon from a convenience into a utility.

It was the lifeline for millions of people stuck at home.

The business exploded.

Revenue soared from $280 billion in 2019 to $469 billion in 2021.

They hired people at an unbelievable rate, adding over 800,000 employees in just two years.

Their stock price hit all-time highs.

The company seemed invincible.

A force of nature that could only go up.

But no tree grows to the sky.

The world began to reopen.

People went back to physical stores.

The historic surge in online shopping started to slow down.

At the same time, inflation began to rise.

The cost of fuel, shipping, and labor all went up.

The era of easy money was ending.

The market turned.

And in 2022, gravity reasserted itself.

It was a brutal year for Amazon.

The company's stock price was nearly cut in half.

It lost more market value than any company in history, shedding over $800 billion.

Then came the financial results.

For the full year of 2022, Amazon posted a net loss of $2.7 billion.

It was their first annual loss since 2014.

The machine was bleeding money again.

The response was swift and painful.

The company began the largest corporate layoffs in its history.

They cut more than 18,000 jobs.

They froze hiring.

They shut down experimental projects.

The era of infinite growth was over.

The new CEO, Andy Jassy, had to pivot the entire company from a mindset of expansion to a mindset of efficiency.

It was a painful reminder that even the most powerful companies are subject to the laws of economic reality.

Success is not a permanent state.

It is a constant, brutal fight against irrelevance and decline.

The story in this book is not about one man's genius.

It is about a set of powerful, often uncomfortable, ideas.

Patience over hype.

Building your own tools.

Staying hungry like a startup.

And respecting the brutal reality of the market.

This is the code.

This is the playbook.

And it is a lesson for anyone trying to build anything of value in a world that is constantly trying to tear it down.
