Customer obsession, as our North Star, means consistently starting with the customer, not the product. Consider Amazon Prime's launch in 2005. Offering unlimited two-day shipping for a fixed $79 annually seemed financially illogical; critics predicted significant losses from shipping costs. Yet, this decision, based purely on customer desire for speed and convenience, transformed the business. By 2021, Prime boasted over 200 million members globally, with these members spending an estimated 4.6 times more than non-members. This customer-first investment didn't just boost sales; it fostered extreme loyalty.

Another example is Amazon Web Services (AWS). Initially an internal solution for Amazon's own scaling, it was productized when they realized other companies faced identical challenges. Today, AWS generates staggering revenue, hitting $90.8 billion in 2023, representing 14% of Amazon's total sales, and a dominant 63% of its operating income.

For you, this highlights a critical lesson: short-term financial sacrifices driven by deep customer understanding can yield immense, long-term strategic advantage. Are your decisions prioritizing immediate profit or enduring customer value? Your North Star should always point to what genuinely benefits your customer, even if it feels counter-intuitive initially.
