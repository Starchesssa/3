Customer obsession, as the North Star, means relentlessly focusing on the customer first, working backward from their needs. It’s not about what Amazon *can* build, but what the customer *truly* wants. This strategy, though sometimes expensive in the short term, is a powerful long-term growth driver. Consider Amazon Prime. The initial investment in free two-day shipping seemed financially challenging; for instance, Amazon’s shipping costs in 2018 surpassed $27.7 billion. However, this customer-centric offering fueled immense loyalty. By 2021, Prime membership globally exceeded 200 million. These members, driven by superior convenience, spend approximately 2.5 times more annually than non-Prime customers, a significant multiplier for Amazon's revenue. Another example is 'frustration-free packaging.' Responding to customer complaints about difficult-to-open boxes, Amazon invested in redesigned packaging, aiming to reduce material by an average of 15% per package. This directly addressed a customer pain point, showcasing how prioritizing user experience, even with upfront operational adjustments, solidifies trust and secures market dominance.
