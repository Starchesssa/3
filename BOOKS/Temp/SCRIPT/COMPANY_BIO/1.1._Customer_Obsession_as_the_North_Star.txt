Imagine a compass pointing north, guiding every step. For Amazon, that compass was always the customer. This isn't just about being friendly; it's a deep, almost obsessive, focus on understanding what your customers truly want and then working backward to deliver it.

Amazon founders didn't start by saying, 'What can we sell?' They asked, 'What do customers need that isn't available, or could be better?' This inspired things like their vast selection, competitive pricing, and even services like Amazon Prime.

For your business, this means constantly asking: 'Are we solving a real customer problem?' 'Does this decision truly benefit them?' If you make the customer your ultimate guide, your North Star, you'll naturally build products and services that truly resonate and drive success.
