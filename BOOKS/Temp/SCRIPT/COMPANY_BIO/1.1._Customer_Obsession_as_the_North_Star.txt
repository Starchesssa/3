"Customer Obsession as the North Star" means every single decision, every new idea, and every action a company takes must start and end with the customer. It's like having a fixed star in the sky that always shows you the way: the customer's needs and happiness are that star. You constantly ask, "What does the customer want or need, even if they don't know it yet?"

Amazon demonstrated this powerfully with its "Free Super Saver Shipping." In the early 2000s, other online shops made customers pay for shipping every time. Amazon chose to offer free shipping for orders over a certain amount, like $25. This decision immediately meant Amazon had to spend more money. Their shipping costs, as a percentage of sales, definitely went up, impacting short-term profits. However, this move dramatically increased customer loyalty. For instance, by 2004, Amazon's active customer accounts exploded to over 47 million, a huge increase driven by this customer-first policy. By prioritizing the customer experience over immediate cost savings, Amazon built a massive, loyal base, proving that making customers happy is the ultimate long-term profit strategy.
