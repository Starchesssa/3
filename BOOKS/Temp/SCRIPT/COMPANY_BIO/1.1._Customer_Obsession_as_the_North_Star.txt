Customer obsession means making the customer your ultimate guide, your North Star. Amazon lives by this, always starting with customer needs and working backward. Think of Amazon Prime: customers wanted fast, reliable shipping. Amazon invested heavily, even when it seemed expensive, because they saw the deep customer desire. This built immense loyalty. Or consider how Amazon embraced customer reviews, positive or negative â€“ empowering you to make informed choices. They also invented the Kindle, simplifying digital reading because customers wanted it easier. This teaches us: your decisions, products, and services should always revolve around solving real customer problems and anticipating their desires. Listen intently, like Amazon did, and be willing to invest in truly delighting them, even if it means complex engineering or a financial gamble. That focus on 'you,' the customer, is your path to success.
