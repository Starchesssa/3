From Amazon's very beginning, Jeff Bezos insisted on one guiding principle: the customer is our North Star. This wasn't just a catchy phrase; it was deeply embedded in their DNA. Imagine important meetings where an empty chair sat at the table. That chair, Bezos explained, represented the customer â€“ the most important person in the room. Every decision, every debate, had to pass the test: how does this benefit the customer?

A groundbreaking example was the introduction of customer reviews. Internally, there was fear. What if people wrote negative reviews? It could hurt sales! But Bezos pushed forward, arguing that honest, unbiased feedback, even critical, empowered customers to make better choices. This radical transparency, putting the customer's trust and experience above short-term sales, became a cornerstone of Amazon's success, building immense loyalty and differentiating them profoundly.
