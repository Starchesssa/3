Customer obsession means you start with the customer and work backward. You do not start with an idea for a product. You start with the customer's need. A powerful example of ignoring this is the video rental company, Blockbuster. In the year 2000, 16 percent of Blockbuster's revenue came from late fees. That was about 800 million dollars. They were obsessed with this revenue, not with their customers who hated the fees. Netflix saw this customer pain point. They built a business with no late fees. By 2010, Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy. Its stock price, which had been nearly 30 dollars a share, plummeted to less than one cent per share. This was a 99 percent drop in value. The company's focus on its own profits over customer happiness led to its complete failure. Amazon learned from this. They believe staying focused on the customer is the only way to survive and grow.
