Customer obsession means you start with the customer and work backwards. Every single choice must answer how it helps the people who buy from you. This idea guided Amazon even to its biggest failures. Think about the Amazon Fire Phone from 2014. The company believed customers wanted a phone that could recognize objects with its camera. They were wrong. The phone sold very poorly. Amazon reported a financial charge of $170 million almost entirely because of the unsold phones. That one product contributed to a total quarterly loss of $437 million. The day after this news, Amazon's stock price dropped more than 8 percent. This single-day drop wiped out almost $15 billion of the company's value. The failure proved a hard lesson. It is not enough to invent something for the customer. The customer must actually want what you invent. Your guiding star must be the customer's real needs, not just your brilliant idea for them.
