Customer Obsession is like having a compass that always points to one direction: the customer. Amazon doesn't start by asking, "What are we good at?" They start by asking, "What does the customer need?"

A perfect, and painful, example of when they forgot this was the Amazon Fire Phone. In 2014, Amazon launched it with features *they* thought were cool, like 3D graphics. But customers never asked for this. The phone launched at $199 with a contract. Within just two months, sales were so bad they had to drop the price to 99 cents.

It was a complete disaster. Amazon had to take a $170 million loss just on unsold phones. This single project was a major reason for the company's worst quarterly stock performance in years, where the stock dropped over 20% in that quarter. This massive failure taught them a lesson worth millions: you must build what the customer truly needs, not what you think is cool. That is the North Star.
