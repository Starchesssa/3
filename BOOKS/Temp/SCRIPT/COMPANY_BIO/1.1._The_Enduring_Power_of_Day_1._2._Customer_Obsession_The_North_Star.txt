**1. The Enduring Power of Day 1**

Imagine you're starting a brand new business today. You're probably super excited, a little nervous, and full of energy. You're hungry to prove yourself, you're trying everything, learning fast, and you're not afraid to change things if they don't work. This feeling, this attitude, is what we call the "Day 1" mindset.

The idea of "The Enduring Power of Day 1" means that even a huge company like Amazon tries to act like it's still that very first day. Why? Because on Day 1, you're constantly looking for new ideas. You're focused on what's next, not just protecting what you already have.

Think about it:
*   On Day 1, you take risks. You experiment. You don't have old rules holding you back. You're eager to try new things.
*   On Day 1, you're flexible. If something isn't working, you pivot quickly and try a different approach.
*   On Day 1, you're totally focused on your customers and what they need, because you need to win them over and prove your worth.

A "Day 2" company, on the other hand, is one that gets comfortable. They might stop taking risks, they might focus on their own internal processes instead of external customers, and they become slow to change. They might think, "We're big enough now, we don't need to push so hard."

Amazon wants to avoid being a "Day 2" company. They want to keep that fresh, inventive, and hungry attitude, always acting like they're just getting started, no matter how big they get. It's about staying nimble and always looking forward to the next big thing for customers.

**2. Customer Obsession: The North Star**

Now, let's talk about "Customer Obsession: The North Star."

A "North Star" is something you look to for direction, especially when you're lost. It's the most important point on your map; it guides all your movements. For Amazon, that North Star is the customer.

"Customer Obsession" means putting the customer at the absolute center of every single decision you make. It's more than just "customer focus," which means you pay attention to customers. Obsession means you think about them constantly, you worry about their problems, and you dedicate yourself to solving those problems, even if it's hard or expensive for you to do.

Here's what it looks like:
*   Instead of thinking, "What product can we build that will make us the most money?" Amazon tries to think, "What problem does the customer have, and how can we solve it in an amazing way?"
*   Imagine you're going to a tailor to get a suit made. A customer-obsessed tailor doesn't just make the suit *they* like. They constantly ask *you*: "How do you want it to fit? What occasions will you wear it for? What would make you feel most comfortable and stylish?" They then make the suit perfectly for *your* needs and desires.
*   For Amazon, this obsession has led to things like:
    *   **Free two-day shipping with Prime:** Customers wanted faster, cheaper delivery, even if it cost Amazon a lot.
    *   **Allowing customer reviews on products:** People wanted to know what others thought before buying, even if some reviews were negative.
    *   **Easy, hassle-free returns:** Customers want to be able to send something back if it's not right, without a lot of fuss.

It's about working backwards from what the customer needs and desires. If you truly obsess over your customers, they will stick with you, tell their friends, and your business will grow naturally. It's the guiding principle that keeps Amazon innovating and evolving.
