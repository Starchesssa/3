Let's talk about two big ideas from the book 'Amazon' that help explain how the company thinks.

**1. The Enduring Power of Day 1**

Imagine you're starting a new business, maybe a small coffee shop. On your very first day – Day 1 – what are you like?

You're probably super energetic. You're trying everything to make your coffee perfect, serving customers quickly, asking for feedback, maybe even staying up late thinking of new ideas. You're hungry to succeed, and you're always looking for ways to improve, because everything feels new and exciting.

That's the "Day 1" mindset Amazon wants to keep, every single day, no matter how big they get.

"Day 2," on the other hand, is when things get comfortable. You stop trying new things, you assume you know everything, you get slow, and you stop listening. That's when businesses can start to decline.

So, for Amazon, "The Enduring Power of Day 1" means:

*   **Always acting like it's the beginning:** Stay hungry, stay innovative, always be ready to experiment and take risks.
*   **Avoid getting lazy or comfortable:** Don't assume success will just continue; you have to work for it every day.
*   **Move fast and adapt:** Like a startup, be quick to change and try new things.

Think of it like a gardener: On Day 1, they're constantly checking the soil, watering, looking for new pests, excited about every sprout. If they get into "Day 2" mode, they might just water occasionally, assume everything's fine, and miss problems until it's too late. Amazon wants to keep that Day 1 gardener energy.

**2. Customer Obsession: The North Star**

Now, for the second big idea: "Customer Obsession: The North Star."

A North Star is something that guides you. If you're lost at sea, the North Star tells you which way to go. For Amazon, the customer is their North Star.

This means that every single decision they make, from the biggest company strategy down to how a small team operates, should start with one question: "What is best for the customer?"

It's not about making decisions based on what competitors are doing, or what's easiest for Amazon, or what makes the most money *right now*. It's about thinking about the customer, first and foremost.

For example, imagine a toy company. A "competitor-focused" toy company might just copy what the most popular toy brand is doing. An "engineer-focused" company might build the toy that's easiest to manufacture.

But a "customer-obsessed" toy company would:

*   **Watch kids play:** What genuinely excites them?
*   **Listen to parents:** What problems do they have with current toys? What do they wish existed?
*   **Even invent things customers don't know they need yet:** Like when Amazon created the Kindle, people didn't know they *needed* an e-reader, but Amazon saw a way to make reading more convenient for customers.

So, "Customer Obsession" means constantly thinking about what the customer wants, needs, and how to make their experience better, even if it requires extra effort or takes a long time to pay off. It's the ultimate guiding principle for everything they do.
