Imagine you’re planting a tiny acorn today. If you’re thinking short-term, you’d want a big oak tree by tomorrow. That’s just not how nature works. You have to be patient, water it, let it grow for years.

This is exactly how Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, thought about their business. They weren't focused on making a quick buck, or even a profit, next quarter. They were looking *years* into the future – five, ten, even fifteen years down the road.

Think of it like this: Most companies try to make money now. They want to show good profits every three months to make their investors happy. Amazon did the opposite. For years, they actually *lost* money or barely broke even.

Why? Because they were "planting acorns" everywhere. They invested heavily in things that wouldn't pay off for a long time:

*   **Building massive warehouses:** Instead of renting small spaces, they built huge, expensive distribution centers all over the world. This cost a fortune upfront, but it meant they could deliver things faster and cheaper years later.
*   **Developing new technology:** They spent tons of money on things like the Kindle e-reader, even when it wasn't clear if people would buy them. They were betting on future reading habits.
*   **Offering incredibly low prices and free shipping:** This meant they made less money on each sale, sometimes even losing money, but it drew millions of customers who then became loyal.

It was like they were building a super-fast highway across the country, knowing it would take years and cost billions. While they were building, everyone else was just driving on slow, local roads and making a little money. People thought Amazon was crazy; they’d say, "They never make a profit!"

But Bezos believed if they focused relentlessly on making things amazing for the customer – more choices, lower prices, super-fast delivery – then eventually, customers would choose Amazon for *everything*. And because they built so much infrastructure and technology over the long haul, other companies found it almost impossible to catch up.

So, the power of long-term thinking for Amazon was simple: Don't chase immediate profits. Instead, make huge investments, be incredibly patient, and focus on what customers will want years from now. By doing that, they grew into the giant we know today, because they were thinking about that big, strong oak tree when everyone else was just trying to sell a few leaves.
